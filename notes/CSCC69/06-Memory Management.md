# Memory Management
So far we have looked at CPU scheduling to share (multiplex) the processor. However, we also need to be able to share main memory as well, since every active process needs memory. We need to achieve the following things:
1. Support enough active processes to keep CPU busy
2. Use memory efficiently (minimize wasted memory)
3. Keep memory management overhead small


* Relocation
	* Programmers don't know how much or what memory is available when a program actually runs.
	* The scheduler may swap processes in/out of memory, and need to bring it back to a different region of memory. Will need some type of **address translation**.

* Local Organization
	* Machine memory addresses are treated as a one-dimensional array of bytes, while programmers organize code in modules. We will need a way to map between these views.

* Protection
	* A process's memory should not have unwanted accesses by other processes, either intentional or accidental.

* Sharing
	* Processes may have shared memory that they need to access. We will need to specify and control what sharing is allowed.

* Physical Organization
	* Information needs to flow between memory and disk, forming a two-level hierarchy. The CPU only has access to data in registers or memory, not disk.

## Address Binding
Program addresses need to be bound to a memory address before executing.

*symbolic* addresses (variable names) are written by the programmer

*logical* addresses are relative to the start of the stack frame

*physical* addresses are addresses in physical memory that the CPU fetches from and stores to.

### Compile-time Bounding
Programs bound at compile time are called *absolute code*, since binary contains physical addresses.

Compile-time bounding requires that we know what memory the process will use beforehand. Relocation is not possible, since addresses are already predetermined in the compiled code.

### Load-time Bounding
Bounding at load time, the compiler translates symbolic addresses to *logical, relocatable* addresses within compilation unit (source file).

Linker takes object files and translates addresses to logical, absolute addresses within executable

loader translates logical absolute addresses to *physical* addresses when program is loaded into memory.

with this approach, programs can be loaded to different addresses to start but cannot be relocated after.

### Execution-Time Bounding
bounding at execution time, the linker takes object files and produces an executable object file containing logical addresses for the entire program. addressesare translated to physical addresses during execution.

This approach will allow for relocating, but requires special hardware to do so.
