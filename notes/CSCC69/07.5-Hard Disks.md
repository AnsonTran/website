# Hard Disks
Hard disk components are shown below:

When reading or writing data to a block, the hard disk does two things:
1. **Seek** - Moves the disk head to the appropriate track
2. **Rotation** - Rotates the disk to the sector to be read
3. **Transfer** - Transfers data to the host

Hard disk I/O is slow. To improve it, we want to:
* Minimize the number of disk accesses (by caching)
* Minimize access costs (by smart request scheduling)

Hard disk operations are very messy, so we don't want the OS to manage the hard disk. It knows a lot more about how to read/write data, than the OS.

## Logical Block Addressing
Instead, the OS sees an abstraction of the hard disk. It sees the storage device as a linear array of blocks.

## Disk Scheduling
Since seeks are expensive, the OS has some disk scheduling algorithms for queued disk requests:
* First Come First Serve
	* Reasonable for when loads are low
	* Lots of seeking, long wait times for long queues
* Shortest Seek Time First
	* Go for the shortest seek time in the queue, maximizes request rate
	* Favors middle blocks
* SCAN (elevator)
	* Service requests from first to last track, and then in reverse
	* 1,2,3,...,n-1,n,n-1,...,3,2,1,...
* C-SCAN
	* Same as SCAN, but don't service on the way back
	* 1,2,3,...,n-1,n,1,2,3,...
* LOOK/C-LOOK
	* Same as SCAN/C-SCAN, but only go as far as the last request in each direction (not full width of the disk)

If there are no request queues, disk scheduling does not have much impact. It is important for servers, but not much for PCs.

Most modern disks do the disk scheduling themselves, so they ignore/undo scheduling done by the OS.

## Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)
Improves I/O performance, and reliability at the same time. There are many different levels of RAID, utilising multiple disks.

Some notable levels of RAID are:

**RAID level 0**: Instead of writing files onto one cylinder, spread the data across multiple cylinders and multiple hard disks. Different parts of a file can be accessed at the same time.

**RAID level 1**: Level 1 takes the level 0 setup, and duplicates the data across another set of disks. One problem is that we need to synchronize the data between the two copies.

**RAID level 4**: Use a hard disk to store parity bits for data checking. For each byte, store a 1 bit if there are an odd number of 1s in the byte, and store a 0 bit if there are an even number ones in the byte.

**RAID level 5**: Take our level 4 setup, but spread the parity strips across the hard disks.
