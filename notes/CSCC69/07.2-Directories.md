# Directories
For users, directories are a structured way to organize files. For the file system, it separates logical file organization from physical file placement on the disk.

Directories are implemented as a file. It lists:
* entries of files 'stored' in the directory
* metadata associated with each file (size, ownership, location, etc.)

Some directory operations:
* search - find a particular file within directory
* create file - add a new entry to the directory
* delete file - remove an entry from the directory
* list directory - list file names and requested attributes of entries
* update directory - record a change to some file's attributes

We can use file operations to create directories. C library provides some abstractions:
* opendir(name)
* readdir(DIR *dir)
* seekdir(DIR *dir)
* closedir(DIR *dir)

Directories can be implemented as:
* Linear list
	* List of file names and pointers to data blocks
	* Linear search to find entries
	* Easy to implement, but slow to execute
* Hash Table
	* Add hash data structure to linear list
	* Hash file name to get pointer to the entry in the linear list

Example opening /one using inodes:
1. Use master block to find inode for "/"
2. Read "/" inode into memory
3. Look for "one" entry in the "/" inode
4. Read "one" inode into memory
5. Read first data block of "one" into memory to access data in the file

## Directory Abstractions
Directories can be abstracted in different ways:
* single-level
* two-level
* tree-structured
* acyclic-graph (same file or subdirectory in 2 different directories)

Unix implemenents an acyclic-graph, which allows for file sharing.
