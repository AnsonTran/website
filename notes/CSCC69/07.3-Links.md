# Links
Sharing can be implemented by creating a new directory entry called a **link**, a pointer to another file or subdirectory

Two different links can be created in a Unix system:
* **Soft link** - The directory entry contains the "true" path to the file.
* **Hard link** - The directory entry is identical to the first.

```c
ln -s target_path link_path # soft link
ln target_path link_path    # hard link
```

When deleting a file:
* Soft links become a dangling pointer (safe)
* Hard links point to a deallocated block - To solve this, we keep a reference count for hard links. When the counter reaches zero, then it is safe to delete.
