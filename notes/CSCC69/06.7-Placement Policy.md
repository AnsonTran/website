# Placement Policy
In paging systems, memory management hardware can translate any virtual-to-physical mapping equally well. 

Placement policies are useful in:
* NUMA(non-uniform memory access) multiprocessors, any processor can access entire memory, but local memory is faster.
* improving cache performance. Choosing physical pages that minimize cache conflicts. 

These are active research areas
