# Investment Function
Investment is the most volatile component of GDP. A fall in the level of investment is one of the factors that leads to a recession.

## Planned Investment
Planned investment, denoted $I_{planned}$, is the level of investment that firms intend to undertake during a given period.

If the returns on investment are predetermined, an increase in interest rate raises the cost of investment, lowering the level of planned investment.
> Planned investment is inversely related to the interest rate

The future outlook of real GDP can positively impact the planned investment. If real GDP is expected to increase, firms would need to undertake more investment in the present day, to meet higher demands in the future.
> Planned investment is positively related to the expected future real GDP

> The **accelerator principle** suggests an increase in expected future real GDP leads to an increase in planned investment. 

The planned investment function is a function of the interest rate. Autonomous investment ($AI$) accounts for any factors other than the interest rate that can affect planned investment (i.e. government). $d$ is a positive constant that reflects the sensitivity of planned investment to the interest rate.
$$I_{planned}=AI-(d\times i)$$

## Unplanned Investment
Firms hold inventories to avoid disruption in the production process and to avoid missing any unforeseen changes in sales.

**Inventory investment** refers to the change in the value of total inventories during a given period. It includes materials and supplies held in storage, work in progress, and finished goods.
$$\text{Inventory investment}=\Delta \text{Inventories}$$
> If shelves run out and inventories need to be reduced to meet demand, then inventory investment is negative!

Since it is very difficult to predict future sales accurately, firms may hold more or less inventories than they planned for. **Unplanned investment** ($I_{planned}$) are the unexpected changes in inventories.
$$I_{unplanned}=\text{unplanned inventory investment}$$

## Actual Investment
Actual investment $I_{actual}$ is the level of investment that the economy has undertaken in a given period of time.
$$\begin{align}
I=I_{actual}&=I_{planned}+I_{unplanned}\\
&=[AI-(d\times i)]+I_{unplanned}
\end{align}$$
