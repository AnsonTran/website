# Balance of Payments
A country's balance of payments (BOP) accounts records a country's **international transactions** with the rest of the world.
* Includes international sales (exports) and purchases (imports) of goods, services, and assets
* Records payments from foreigners and payments to foreigners

The BOP account is divided into two components:
1. **Current account** - Movements of goods and services
2. **Financial account** - Movements of assets

## Current Account
Records international flows of goods and services, net factor income, and net international transfer payments.

<tr> <td>=</td> <td>Current account balance</td> </tr>
</table>

## Financial Account

* Records the international flows of financial capital (dominated by financial assets, i.e. stocks, bonds)
* International transactions by the private sector and the central bank. Foreign assets (denominated in foreign currency) held by the central bank are called **official reserves**.
