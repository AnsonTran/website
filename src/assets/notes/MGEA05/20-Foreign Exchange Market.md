# Foreign Exchange Market
Markets for the conversion of one country's currency to another. The foreign exchange market is the world's largest market.

## Exchange Rate
An exchange rate is the number of foreign currency ($FC$) that converts to one unit of domestic currency ($DC$), $E_{FC/DC}$.
* $E_{FC/DC}$ increases, means more $FC$ are needed to exchange one unit of $DC$. $DC$ appreciates.
* $E_{FC/DC}$ decreases, means fewer $FC$ are needed to exchange one unit of $DC$. $DC$ depreciates.

When one currency appreciates, the other currency depreciates, since the exchange rate is relative to each other.

Exchange rates comes from a country's BOP accounts, since they give us the **demand for** and **supply of** a country's currency in the foreign exchange market.

## Demand for Domestic Currency
The demand for domestic currency $D_{DC}$ comes from **exports** of goods, services, and assets. This curve is **downward sloping** because, as our domestic currency appreciates:
* Domestic goods, services, and assets become more expensive
* Domestic exports decreases
* Demand for domestic currency decreases

|Factor|Reason|
|---|---|
|Increase in foreign output|Foreigners purchase more foreign and domestic goods. From our perspective, we export more|
|Increase in capital inflows|Increase in exports of assets|
|Consumption favours domestic goods|Exports of goods and services increases|
|Provision of export subsidies|Exports become cheaper. Exports increase.|

Any factor that affects exports, other than exchange rate $E_{FC/DC}$ will shift the demand curve. If exports:
* Increase, demand curve shifts right
* Decrease, demand curve shifts left

## Supply of Domestic Currency
The supply of domestic currency $S_{DC}$ is **upwards sloping** because, as our domestic currency appreciates:
* Domestic goods, services, and assets become more expensive
* Domestic imports increases
* Supply of domestic currency increases

|Factor|Reason|
|---|---|
|Increase in domestic output|Increase in imports of goods and services|
|Increase in capital outflows|Local assets become less attractive. Increased import of foreign assets|
|Consumption favours foreign goods|Greater demand for foreign goods. Imports increase|
|Decrease in import tariffs|Foreign goods become cheaper. Imports increase|

Any factors that affects imports, other than exchange rate $E_{FC/DC}$ will shift the supply curve. If imports:
* Increase, supply curve shifts right
* Decrease, supply curve shifts left

## Foreign Exchange Market
The foreign exchange market measures the supply-demand of domestic currency.
* If the exchange rate is too high, supply of domestic currency is greater than demand, causing it to depreciate.
* If the exchange rate is too low, demand of domestic currency is greater than supply, causing it to appreciate.

Suppose the domestic government provides an export subsidy (payment to firms that when they export goods).
* Domestic goods become less expensive in the world market
* Increase in the export of goods
* Increase demand in our domestic currency
* At the current exchange rate, there is excess demand for domestic currency
* The domestic currency appreciates

## Real Exchange Rates
The nominal exchange rate $E_{FC/DC}$ is unadjusted for international difference in aggregate price levels. The real exchange rate $RE_{FC/DC}$ takes this into account.
$$\begin{align}
RE_{FC/DC}&=E_{FC/DC}\times \frac{P_H}{P_F}\\
&=\frac{\#\ of\ FC}{DC}\times(\frac{\frac{\#\ of\ DC}{domestic\ goods}}{\frac{\#\ of\ FC}{foreign\ goods}})\\
&=\frac{\#\ of\ FC}{DC}\times(\frac{\#\ of\ DC}{domestic\ goods})\times(\frac{foreign\ goods}{\#\ of\ FC})\\
&=\frac{\#\ of\ foreign\ goods}{domestic\ goods}

\end{align}$$

A country's net exports and current account depend on the real exchange rate, because a country's products become cheaper only when the country's currency depreciates in real terms (i.e., it takes fewer units of foreign goods to exchange a unit of domestic goods).
