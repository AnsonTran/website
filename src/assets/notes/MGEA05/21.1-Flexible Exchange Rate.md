# Flexible Exchange Rate
The central bank does not set an official exchange rate, instead letting demand and supply control it. 

## Monetary Policy
Monetary policy is **effective** under a flexible exchange rate country. Changes in monetary policy will lead to a change in output in the short run.

Suppose the central bank runs expansionary [[15-Monetary Policy|monetary policy]].
* Money supply $MS$ increases, lowering the interest rate
	* Cost of borrowing decreases, causing an increase in planned investment $I_{planned}$
	* Consumption $C$ increases
	* Planned expenditure $AE_{planned}$ and aggregate demand $AD$ increase
	* Output $Y$ increases
* Domestic assets become less attractive, leading to:
	* Decrease in export of assets, leading to capital inflows and decrease in demand for domestic currency
	* Increase in import of assets, leading to capital outflows and increase in supply of domestic currency
* The domestic currency depreciates, making domestic goods cheaper
	* Exports increase
	* Imports decrease
* Planned expenditure $AE_{planned}$ increases further, driving up aggregate demand
* Output increases further

### Example
Suppose we have the following equations:
|Component|Value|
|---|---|
|Consumption|$C=600+0.75YD$|
|Taxes|$T=120+0.15Y$|
|Transfers|$TR=400-0.05Y$|
|Investment|$I_{planned}=700-5000i,\ where\ \bar{i}=2\%$|
|Government Spending|$G=500$|
|Exports|$X=280-15E_{FC/DC},\ where\ E_{FC/DC}=1$|
|Imports|$IM=250+0.1Y+25E_{FC/DC}$|

1. Without accounting for the change in exchange rate, the initial eqilibrium is ($i=0.02,\ E_{FC/DC}=1$):
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=1900+0.5Y\\
Y^*&=3800
\end{align}$$

2. The central bank employs expansionary monetary policy, lowering the interest rate by 0.5% ($i=0.015$). This leads to the following change in planned investment
$$\Delta I_{planned}=(-d\times\Delta i)=(-5000\times -0.005)=25$$

3. Autonomous expenditure increases by the same amount
$$\Delta AE_0=25$$

4. Taking into account the changing interest rate, the new equilibrium is ($i=0.015,\ E_{FC/DC}=1$)
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=1925+0.5Y\\
Y^*&=3850
\end{align}$$

5. The lowering interest rate causes the domestic currency to depreciate to 0.75. Domestic goods and services become less expensive
$$\Delta E_{FC/DC}=0.75-1=-0.25$$

6. Cheaper domestic currency causes an increase in exports
$$\Delta X=(-X_1\times\Delta E_{FC/DC})=(-15\times(-0.25))=3.75$$

7. Cheaper domestic currency causes a decrease in imports
$$\Delta IM=(IM_2\times\Delta E_{FC/DC})=(25\times(-0.25))=-6.25$$

8. Overall change in autonomous expenditure taking into account both interest rate and depreciation
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=(AE_0^0+\Delta AE_0)+[MPC\times(1-t-tr)-IM_1]\times Y\\
&=[1900+35]+0.5Y\\
&=1935+0.5Y
\end{align}$$

9. The new equilibrium
$$\begin{align}
Y&=1935+0.5Y\\
0.5Y&=1935\\
Y^*&=3870
\end{align}$$

| |$AE_{planned}$ function|$Y^*$|
|---|---|---|
|$i=0.02,E=1$|$1900+0.5Y$|$3800$|
|$i=0.015,E=1$|$1925+0.5Y$|$3850$|
|$i=0.015,E=0.75$|$1935+0.5Y$|$3870$|

## Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy is **less effective** under a flexible exchange rate. 

Suppose the government runs expansionary [[14-Fiscal Policy|fiscal policy]].
* Government spending increases
* Planned expenditure $AE_{planned}$ and aggregate demand $AD$ increases
* Output increases

Crowding out effects:
* Increase in money demand, leads to increase in interest rate
* Cost of borrowing goes up, leading to a decrease in planned investment
* Today's consumption becomes more expensive, decreasing consumption

In an open economy, an increase in interest rate causes domestic assets to be more attractive
* Export of assets increases, increasing demand for domestic currency
* Import of assets decreases, reducing supply for domestic currency
* Domestic currency appreciates
* Domestic goods and services become more expensive
* Exports decrease, imports increase
* Net export decreases

When $C,\ NX,\ I_{planned}$ decreases due to an increase in interest rate and an appreciation of domestsic currency, there will be a subsequent drop in $AE_{planned}$. This offsets some of the increase in planned expenditure from increased government spending.

Overall, $AE_{planned},\ AD,\ Y$ increase by a smaller amount.

### Example
1. Without accounting for the change in exchange rate, the initial eqilibrium is ($G=500,\ i=0.02,\ E_{FC/DC}=1$):
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=1900+0.5Y\\
Y^*&=3800
\end{align}$$

2. The government increases its spending by 50. This leads to a new equilibrium ($G=550,\ i=0.02,\ E_{FC/DC}=1$):
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=1950+0.5Y\\
Y^*&=3900
\end{align}$$

3. Increase in money demand leads to an increase in the interest rate by 0.5%:
$$\Delta I_{planned}=(-d\times\Delta i)=[-5000\times0.005]=-25$$

4. Change in planned expenditure:
$$\Delta AE_0=\Delta G+\Delta I_{planned}=50+(-25)=25$$

5. The new equilibrium ($G=550,\ i=0.025,\ E_{FC/DC}=1$):
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=1925+0.5Y\\
Y^*&=3850
\end{align}$$

6. The domestic currency appreciates to 1.2, leading to changes in imports and exports
$$\begin{align}
\Delta X&=(-X_1\times\Delta E_{FC/DC})\\
&=[-15\times0.2]=-3\\
\Delta IM&=IM_2\times\Delta E_{FC/DC}\\
&=[25\times0.2]=5\\
\Delta AE_0&=\Delta G+\Delta I_{planned}+\Delta X-\Delta IM\\
&=60-25-3-5=17\\
\end{align}$$

7. The new equilibrium ($G=550,\ i=0.025,\ E_{FC/DC}=1.2$):
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=1917+0.5Y\\
Y^*&=3834
\end{align}$$

| |$AE_{planned}$ function|$Y^*$|
|---|---|---|
|$G=500,i=0.02,E=1$|$1900+0.5Y$|$3800$|
|$G=550,i=0.02,E=1$|$1950+0.5Y$|$3900$|
|$G=550,i=0.025,E=1$|$1925+0.5Y$|$3850$|
|$G=550,i=0.025,E=1.2$|$1917+0.5Y$|$3834$|
