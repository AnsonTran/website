# Macroeconomic Policy
Macroeconomic policies available to the government is available in two forms:
1. **Fiscal policy** - Government's choice in level of spending, taxes, and transfer payments
2. **Monetary policy** - Central bank's choice regarding the level of money supply. A change in money supply causes interest rates to change, leading to a change in autonomous expenditure (because it affects the costs of planned investment and current consumption)

These policies are referred to as **stabilization policy**, which aim at reducing the fluctuations in output in the short run (keeping $Y$ close to $Y_{FE}$ in the short run).
