# International Business Cycles
## Goods Market Changes
If an economy experiences changes from the goods market ($AC,AI,G,T_0,TR_0,X_0,IM_0$), flexible exchange rates will lead to a smaller change in output
* Flexible exchange rate - The initial change in $C,I,X,IM$ on Y will be offset by the subsequent change in planned expenditure due to changes in interest rate and exchange rate
* Fixed exchange rate - There won't be any subsequent changes in planned expenditure (because there are no changes in interest rate and exchange rate)

## Money Market Changes
Fixed exchange rate minimizes the fluctuations in output if the shock comes from the money market, say changes in money demand.
* Flexible exchange rate - The initial change in the money demand on Y is **reinforced** by the subsequent change in planned expenditure due to a change in exchange rate
* Fixed exchange rate - The initial change in money demand on Y is fully offset by the subsequent change in MS, so there is no change in planned expenditure
