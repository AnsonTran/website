# Consumption Function
Before we develop the consumption function, we first need to define a few assumptions about consumer spending:

Recall the definition of disposable income:

![[07-Savings and Investment#Disposable Income]]

## Assumptions
Households split their disposable income between spending and savings.
$$YD=C+S_{Private}$$
 When there is a change in disposable income, households divide the change between change in consumption, and change in private savings.
$$\Delta YD=\Delta C + \Delta S_{private}$$
 For a change in current disposable income, the fraction of the income change spent on consumption (**marginal propensity to consume**) is constant.
$$MPC=\frac{\Delta Consumption}{\Delta Disposable Income}=\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta YD},\ 0<MPC<1$$
The **marginal propensity to save** is the fraction of income change gone into private savings. It is equal to $1-MPC$.
$$MPS=\frac{\Delta S_{private}}{\Delta Disposable\ Income}=\frac{\Delta S_{private}}{\Delta YD}=1-MPC$$

Consumption is **positively** related to current disposable income.

## Simple Consumption Function
For a household, even if their disposable income goes to zero, there are still consumption needs that must be met. **Autonomous consumption** is the aggregate consumption needs of the economy.

As we increase disposable income, consumption in the economy increases by the marginal propensity to consume. Hence, the simple consumption function is defined as:
$$C=C(YD)=AC+(MPC\times YD)$$
> AC - Autonomous consumption
> MPC - Marginal propensity to consume
> YD - Disposable income

## Expected Future Disposable Income
Aggregate consumption can be affected by what we are expecting our future disposable income to be. Holding all else constant, autonomous consumption (AC) increases when expected future disposable income increases.

A change in expected disposable income can also depend on whether it is a temporary increase, or a permanent increase.
* **Temporary increase** - Save most of the increase in income, and spend a small portion of the increased income now. This is a one-time increase in income, so households want to spread this increase over many years.
* **Permanent increase** - Households would spend most of the increase in income now, and save a small portion. This is a reoccuring increase year after year.

> The **permanent income hypothesis** argues that consumption ultimately depends on the income housholds expect to have over the long run, rather than on their current income.

## Aggregate Wealth
Holding all else constant, an increase in households wealth (or perception of wealth) leads to an increase in autonomous consumption.

When household wealth increases, the need to save decreases. Consumption increases even if there is no change in disposable income.

> The **life-cycle hypothesis** argues households plan consumption over their lifetime. They try to smooth out consumption over their lifetime, saving some of their current income during peak earning years, and running down the wealth accumulated after retirement
