# Inflation
Inflation refers to a rise in the overall price level. Similarly, deflation is a fall in the overall price level.
$$\pi_t=\frac{PriceLevel_t - PriceLevel_{t-1}}{PriceLevel_{t-1}}\times100\%$$

Some argue that we should not worry about inflation as long as **real income does not fall** as a result (i.e. real GDP per capita increases). The price level does not really matter, but the rate of change, or **inflation rate** does. Higher inflation rate imposes a cost to the economy.

We can use CPi as a proxy for the price level to compute real GDP per capita.
$$RGDP\ per\ capita = \frac{NGDP\ per\ capita}{CPI}\times100$$

### Shoe-Leather Costs
A high inflation rate means the purchasing power of money is being eroded at a faster rate, discouraging people from holding money. They may instead hold their money in other interest-earning assets, and incur higher transaction costs (i.e. withdrawing from an account).

### Menu Costs
Firms may find that the input costs are going up, causing them to change prices. They may have to print a new set of menus, changing labels, etc. These menu costs are normally incurred by firms.

With technological advancements, menu costs can be reduced. For example, online stores may have lower menu costs.

### Unit-of-Account Costs
Money may no longer be a realiable unit of measurement, making it difficult for households to purchase necessities, or firms to produce the right amount of goods to return a profit.

These costs can be solved by **indexation**, where we adjust the nominal or dollar value to the inflation rate (i.e. Old-age pensions or minimum wage).

## Unexpected Inflation
Unexpected inflation occurs when the actual inflation rate is above the expected inflation rate. In this case, we have an unexpected rise in inflation.

Unexpected inflation leads to an arbitrary redistribution of wealth among members in the economy.

The **fisher equation** attempts to link the relationship between nominal interest rate, real interest rate, and inflation rate.
$$\text{Nominal interest rate}(i)= \text{Real interest rate}(r) + \text{Inflation rate}(\pi)$$

Nominal interest rate is the normally reported interest rate, and inflation rate is known. The real interest rate is the one that really matters. It represents the actual return of a loan for lenders, and the amount needed to service a debt.
$$r=i-\pi$$

**Ex-ante form** - What we expect to happen
$$expected\ r=i-expected\ inflation$$
**Ex-post form** - The actual, realized interest
$$actual\ r=i-actual\ inflation$$
