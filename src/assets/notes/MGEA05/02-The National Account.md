# The National Account
## Gross Domestic Product
GDP is the total value of all **final goods and services** produced in the economy during a given year
* Only goods and services sold to final/end users
* Intermediate goods and services are not counted
* Looks at the value of products produced within the economy

| | Canadian Ore (sold to CS) | Canadian Steel (sold to CM) | Canadian Motors (sold to consumers)|
|-------|---|---|---|
| Sales |$4200|$9000|$21500|
|Intermediate goods|$0|$4200|$9000|
|Wages|$2000|$3700|$10000|
|Interest payments|$1000|$600|$1000|
|Rent|$200|$300|$500|
|Profit|$1000|$200|$1000|

## Value-Added Approach
Value-added approach to measuring GDP focuses on the value added of each producer in the economy

> Value added = Value of sales - Value of purchases of intermediate goods and services

> **Canadian Ore Value-Added**: $4200 - $0 = $4200
> **Canadian Steel Value-Added**: $9000 - $4200 = $4800
> **Canadian Motors Value-Added**: $21500 - $9000 = $12500
> **GDP**: $4200 + $4800 + $12500 = $21500

## Expenditure Approach
Expenditure approach adds up domestically produced final goods and services by households, firms, governments, and foreign buyers. Its the sum of 4 major categories:
1. **Consumptionï¼ˆC)**: Spending by households on goods and services
2. **Investment (I)**: Spending on goods not for present consumption (private and public investment)
	* **Business fixed investment**: Purchases of capital equipment, machinery, and production plants
	* **Residential investment**: Building of *new* houses
	* **Inventory investment**: Change in quantity of goods held in storage, including materials and supplies, work in process, and finished goods
3. **Government spending (G)**: Spending on goods and services by government
	* Transfer payments are not included (old age pensions, child care benefits, etc.). They do not affect the demand for goods and services directly
4. **Net Exports (NX)**: Exports - Imports. Net exports is the only metric that can be negative (imports more goods and services than exports)
	* Consumption, investment, and government spending may include imported goods. These should not be included in the GDP.

The national income identity is defined as:
$$GDP = C + I + G + X - IM = C+ I + G + NX$$  ^c1f75e

> GDP = $21500 + $0 + $0 + $0 

## Income Approach
Income approach looks at income earned from production of goods and services. There are two sources of income:
1. **Factor Incomes**: Income earned by factors of production or inputs such as wages, salaries, rent, business profits (those involed in production of goods and services directly)
2. **Non-factor Incomes**: Difference between prices paid for final goods and services and the amount received by production factors before income taxes are removed. Non-factor payments include net indirect taxes (sales taxes - production subsidies), capital depreciation (wear and tear of capital).

> GDP = Wages + Interest payments + Rent + Profit + Non-factor payments

> GDP = ($2000 + $3700 + $10000) + ($1000 + $600 + $1000) + ($200 + $300 + $500) + ($1000 + $200 + $1000) + $0 = $21500

## Summary
Both expenditure approach and income approach gave the same GDP. This is because one person's spending is another person's income. For the economy as a whole, total spending is equal to total income.

GDP is the most commonly used measure of the size of an economy, and allows us to compare a country's economic performance to other countries. However, the following items are not included in the GDP:
* Inputs and intermediate goods and services
* Used goods
* Financial assets (bonds, stocks, mutual funds)
* Foreign-produced goods and services
* Household production and volunteer work
* Underground economic transactions and illegal activities
* Harm done to the environment during production or consumption of goods

## Gross National Product
While GDP is concerned with goods and services produced **within a country**, GNP is focused on goods and services produced **by a country's residents**. Hence:

>GNP = GDP + (Income earned by Canadians outside canada - Income earned by foreigners in Canada)
>GNP = GDP + Net factor income earned abroad

We will generally focus on GDP, instead of GNP.

## Real and Nominal GDP
Year over year, GDP may go up if firms **increase prices**, **increase production**, or both. Real GDP takes out the effects of price changes, in order to get a more accurate measure of economic growth.

Nominal GDP for year $t$ is calculated as a weighted sum of year $t$'s prices and year $t$ quantities
$$NGDP(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}P_{i,t}Q_{i,t}$$

Real GDP for year $t$ is calculated as a weighted sum of base year $b$'s prices and year $t$'s quantities. 
$$RGDP(b,t)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}P_{i,b}Q_{i,t}$$

*Example: Let year 1 be the base year*
| Year | Price X | Price Y | Quantity X | Quantity Y|
|-------|---|---|---|---|
|1|$1|$2|10|15|
|2|$1.5|$3|20|30|
|3|$2|$4|20|30|

>$NGDP(1)=(\$1*10)+(\$2*15)=\$40$
>$NGDP(2)=(\$1.5*20)+(\$3*30)=\$120$
>$NGDP(3)=(\$2*20)+(\$4*30)=\$160$

>$RGDP(1,1)=\$40$
>$RGDP(1,2)=\$80$
>$RGDP(1,3)=\$80$

## Real GDP per Capita
Real GDP takes out the effect of prices changes, but does not account for population size. Countries with larger populations tend to have a higher GDP.

Real GDP per capita eliminates the differences in population size
$$RGDP\ per\ capita = \frac{RGDP}{Population}$$
Its a commonly used measure to compare labour productivity across countries. Higher real GDP per capita countries tend to have higher living standards. However:
* It ignores distribution of output across the population
* Does not address how the output is used to affect living standards
