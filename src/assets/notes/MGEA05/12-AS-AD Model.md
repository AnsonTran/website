# AS-AD Model
By looking at aggregate supply and demand together, we can look at different equilibriums.

The **short-run equilibrium** occurs when the aggregate demand equals to the aggregate supply in the short run.
$$AD\ \text{intersects}\ SRAS$$
The **long-run equilibrium** occurs when the short-run equilibrium is on the $LRAS$ curve. In the long run, output $Y$ must equal to output at full-employment $Y_{FE}$.
$$AD,SRAS,LRAS\ \text{intersect at the same point}$$

## Output Gap
An output gap occurs when the short-run level of output $Y^*=Y_{SR}$ to be different from the long-run level of output $Y_{FE}$.
* **Inflationary gap** occurs when $Y_{SR}>Y_{FE}$
* **Recessionary gap** occurs when $Y_{SR}<Y_{FE}$

Gap is usually measured as a percentage, with: $$\text{Output gap}=\frac{Y_{SR}-Y_{FE}}{Y_{FE}}$$

In the long run, there is a natural adjustment mechanism that will shift the SRAS such that they all meet at the long run equilibrium.
* **Inflationary gap** - Pressure occurs for wages to rise, since it is difficult for firms to hire workers who have higher bargaining power in the current economy.
* **Recessionary gap** - Pressure occurs for nominal wages to fall, since current level of unemployment is high and workers are willing to accept lower wages.
