# Fixed Exchange Rate
The central bank intervenes when exchange rates deviate, in order to ensure the market exchange rate is fixed at the official rate. It can do so by:
1. **Foreign exchange market intervention** - Adjusting its official reserves (foreign currency denominated assets)
2. Adjusting money supply via other methods such as open market operations
3. Imposing capital controls (restricting movement of financial capital)

> Foreign exchange market intervention is the most commonly used method, so we will assume that governments use it.

## Official Rate
The central bank tries to set an official rate close to the market rate. However in some cases, they may set the rate too high or too low.

An **overvalued** domestic currency causes:
* Excess supply of domestic currency
* There will be pressure for DC to depreciate to market rate
* Central bank buys up excess supply of domestic currency
* Central bank sells foreign currency
* Official reserve decreases

An **undervalued** domestic currency causes:
* Excess demand for domestic currency
* There will be pressure for DC to appreciate to market rate
* Central bank buys foreign currency
* Central bank sells domestic currency
* Official reserve increases

> For an overvalued domestic currency, maintaining the official rate can cause the official reserves to deplete. The country is in a currency crisis if there is less than 3 months worth of reserve

## Devaluation and Revaluation
In a fixed exchange rate regime, the exchange rate can change through:
* **Devaluation** - A decrease in the official value of a currency, causing $E_{FC/DC}$ to decrease
* **Revaluation** - An increase in the official value of a currency, causing an increase in $E_{FC/DC}$

Suppose a country in a fixed exchange rate regime devalues its currency:
* Domestic goods and services become less expensive
* Increase in exports
* Decrease in imports
* Increase in net exports
* Planned expenditure $AE_{planned}$ increases
* Output increases

## Monetary Policy
Monetary policy is **ineffective** under fixed exchange rate.

Suppose the central bank runs expansionary monetary policy
* Money supply $MS$ increases, lowering the interest rate
	* Cost of borrowing decreases, causing an increase in planned investment $I_{planned}$
	* Consumption $C$ increases
	* Planned expenditure $AE_{planned}$ and aggregate demand $AD$ increase
	* Output $Y$ increases
* Domestic assets become less attractive, leading to:
	* Decrease in export of assets, leading to capital inflows and decrease in demand for domestic currency
	* Increase in import of assets, leading to capital outflows and increase in supply of domestic currency
* The domestic currency depreciates, deviating from the official exchange rate

The central bank now has to intervene, in order to bring the exchange rate back to the official exchange rate. 
* Buying of domestic currency and selling of foreign currency
* Money supply decreases back to its initial level such that interest rate increases back to its initial level and the capital flows stop

As a result, there is no change in:
* Autonomous expenditure
* Planned expenditure
* Aggregate demand
* Output

## Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy is **effective** under a fixed exchanged rate regime. The crowding out of investments and net exports disappears.

Suppose the government runs expansionary fiscal policy
* Government spending increases
* Planned expenditure, aggregate demand, and output increases

Crowding out effects:
* Increase in money demand, leads to increase in interest rate
* Cost of borrowing goes up, leading to a decrease in planned investment
* Today's consumption becomes more expensive, decreasing consumption

In an open economy, an increase in interest rate causes domestic assets to be more attractive
* Export of assets increases, increasing demand for domestic currency
* Import of assets decreases, reducing supply for domestic currency
* Domestic currency appreciates, deviating from the official exchange rate

The central bank now has to intervene, in order to bring the exchange rate back to the official exchange rate.
* Money supply increases, such that the interest rate decreases until it is back to its initial level and the capital flows stop

As a result, there is no change in the interest rate or exchange rate. Only factor that affects expenditure is the initial change in government spending. There is no crowding out effect.
