# Aggregate Demand
Aggregate demand shows the relationship between the aggregate price level and the quantity of aggregate output demanded by all sectors in the economy (households, firms, the government, and the foreign sector).

Holding all else constant, when the aggregate price level increases, the demand for goods and services by all sectors in the economy goes down.
> Aggregate-demand curve is downwards sloping

Besides government spending, $C,I,X,IM$ all depend on the private sector. Hence, we need to understand how a change in price levels $P$ affects these components.

> From microeconomics, we might argue that as prices increase, demand for goods and services decreases. However, we are looking at this from a macro perspective, so we need to look at aggregate demand.

Overall, if all prices increase including labour and capital, then dollar incomes also increase. If incomes and prices increase at the same rate, then **real income** ($\frac{\text{Dollar Income}}{Price}$) stays the same, because purchasing power does not change.

## Effects on Aggregate Demand
The downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve can be explained by the effects of wealth and interest rate on aggregate price level.

### Wealth 
Holding all else constant, a rise in aggregate price lowers the real value of existing assets, and the real value of wealth.

Real value of wealth is defined as:
$$\text{Real value of wealth}=\frac{$ value}{price}$$
When prices increase, wealth decreases, leading to a reduction in consumption and lowering the aggregate demand.

### Interest Rate
Holding all else constant, interest rates rise when aggregate price increases because the purchasing power of our existing money holdings falls.

In order to purchase the same amount of goods or services, we need to withdraw from holdings, or borrow in order to increase their money holdings.

This would lead to an increase in interest rate, increase the cost of borrowing, and lowering the overall level of investment. An increase in interest rate leads to:
* $C$ **decreases** - Makes consumption more expensive, lowering consumption
* $I$ **decreases** - An increasing in the cost of borrowing, lowering overall investment
* $NX$ **decreases** - An open economy experiences net capital inflows, appreciating the domestic currency. This leads to a decrease in exports, and an increase in imports (i.e. a decrease in net exports).

## Aggregate Demand Curve
The aggregate demand curve can be derived from the income-expenditure model. We assume that the aggregate price level is fixed.

The aggregate demand summarizes the relationship between the aggregate price level and the quantity of aggregate output demanded by all sectors of the economy.

Suppose the planned expenditure function is given as:
$$AE_{planned}(P)=AE_0-\lambda P+MPC(Y)$$
> $\lambda$ expresses the sensitivity of planned expenditure to price levels.

The aggregate demand function is derived by equating $Y$ to the aggregate expenditure function for the equilibrium.
$$\begin{align}
Y&=AE_{planned}(P)\\
&=AE_0-\lambda P + MPC(Y)\\
Y&=(\frac{1}{1-MPC})AE_0-(\frac{\lambda}{1-MPC})P&[1]\\
P&=(\frac{1}{\lambda})AE_0-(\frac{1-MPC}{\lambda})Y&[2]
\end{align}$$
> Aggregate demand equations can be expressed in terms of $Y$ or $P$.

## Shifts in Aggregate Demand
Overall, changes in autonomous expenditure $AE_0$ will shift the aggregate demand curve. If we see an increase in $AE_0$, the curve shifts to the right, while if we see a decrease in $AE_0$, the curve shifts to the left.

Recall the definition of autonomous expenditure.
![[11-Income-Expenditure Model#^5ea315]]

These factors causes an increase in autonomous expenditure $AE_0$, causing a shift of the demand curve to the right.

| Factors | Why |
|---|---|
|Increase in consumer confidence|Households become more optimistic. $AC$ increases.|
|Increase in business confidence|Firms become more optimistic, incentivizing investment. $AI$ increases.|
| Increase in wealth|Households feel that they become richer. $AI$ increases.|
|Low existing stock of physical capital|Firms have little room to increase production, incentivizing investment. $AI$ increases.|
|Increase in government spending$^{[1]}$|$G$ increases|
|Decrease in lump-sum taxes$^{[1]}$|$C$ increases by $MPC\times\Delta T_0$.|
|Increase in lump-sum transfers$^{[1]}$|$C$ increases by $MPC\times\Delta TR_0$.|
|Money supply increases$^{[2]}$|Agents have more money holdings than they want. They will get rid of it by lending it out. Interest rate decreases, $AC$ increases, $I_{planned}$ increases, net exports increases.|
|Foreign demand for domestic goods increases|$X_0$ increases.|
|Domestic demand for foreign goods falls (i.e. trade tariffs or quotas)|$IM_0$ decreases.|
