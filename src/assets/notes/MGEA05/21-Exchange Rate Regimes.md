# Exchange Rate Regimes
An exchange rate regime is a rule governing policy towards the exchange rate:
* **Floating/Flexible exchange rate** - Exchange rate is determined by the market forces. Examples include Canada, the U.S.
* **Fixed exchange rate** - Exchange rate is held fixed at a pre-specified level. Examples include Hong Kong, Bulgaria, Denmark

## Arguments for Fixed Exchange Rate
While not as commonly used, some countries may employ a fixed exchange rate for various reasons:
* **Exchange rate uncertainty** - Firms dont have to worry about a changing exchange rate, which promotes international trade and investments
* **Central bank limits** - Prevents excessive, expansionary monetary policies. The central bank cannot use monetary policy to affect the economy
* **Stronger fiscal policy** - Fiscal policy is more powerful/effective
* **Weaker monetary policy** - Monetary policy is ineffective

## Arguments for Flexible Exchange Rate
A flexible exchange rate can be beneficial because:
* **Monetary policy autonomy** - The central bank can design and implement monetary policy that best suits the economy
* **Official reserves** - The country does not have to maintain a large stock of official reserves in order to ensure the fixed rate.
* **Currency crisis** - Without worrying about official reserves, the risk of a currency crisis is lower
* **More efficient fund allocation** - No capital controls need to be placed in order to maintain a fixed official rate
