# Monetary Policy
Monetary policy is implemented by the Bank of Canada. It sets an explicit **inflation target**, and ensures the target is met through its monetary policy:
* The current inflation target is $2\%$, with a target range of $1-3\%$.
* The BOC adjusts the target for the overnight rate, to achieve the inflation rate
* Once the inflation rate stays within the target range, the BOC uses monetary policy to smooth out the business cycles
* Adopting inflation targeting offers transparency and accountability

## Change in Overnight Rate
Suppose the inflation rate is within the inflation target range, the BOC lowers the target for the overnight rate to close a recessionary gap.
* Decrease in the interest rate
* Decrease in the cost of borrowing
* Our assets become less attractive, leading to capital outflows, and depreciation of our currency
* Our goods become cheaper on the world market, increasing exports and suppressing imports.
* Autonomous expenditure increases, shifting AD to the right.

Changes in the target for the overnight rate affects the economy through four different channels:
1. Interest rate on other assets and loans
2. Asset prices
3. Exchange rate
4. Market expectations

## Zero Lower Bound Problem
It seems the central bank can lower interest rates (expansionary monetary policy) to stimulate the economy or close a recessionary gap. However, nominal interest rates cannot be negative.

Central banks in developed countries facing the recent financial crisis, lowered the interest rate so much, that it could not continue to be lowered.

To resolve the problem, central banks rolled out **quantitative easing**, purchases of long-term corporate bonds in order to lower the long-term interest rate and exerting an expansionary effect on the economy. The BOC did not use QE during the 2008 financial crisis, but started the first QE program in April 2020.
