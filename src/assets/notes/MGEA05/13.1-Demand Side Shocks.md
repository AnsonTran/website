# Demand Side Shocks
Assume initially, that the market is at its long-term equilibrium. Suppose households decide to save more. This leads to:
* Decrease in today's consumption
* Decrease in aggregate consumption
* Decrease in autonomous expenditure
* AD shifts to the left

This shifts the short-run equilibrium to point B, which causes:
* Decrease in output
* Decrease in aggregate prices
* Increase in unemployment rate below natural rate of employment

## Maintain the Status Quo
If we do not apply any monetary policies, the economy will self adjust in the long-term:
* Since output is below full employment, there will be pressure for wages to fall
* Decrease in per-unit production cost and increase in per-unit profit
* SRAS shifts to the right
* Point C becomes the point of LR equilibrium.

## Counter-Cyclical Stalization Policy
On the other hand, we can respond to the shock through **expansionary fiscal policy** that acts in the opposite direction:
* Increasing government spending
* Lowering lump-sum taxes
* Increasing lump-sum transfers
* Increasing money supply

These leads to an increase in autonomous expenditure $AE_0$, shifting aggregate demand to the right.
