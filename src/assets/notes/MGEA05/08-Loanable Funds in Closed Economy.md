# Loanable Funds in Closed Economy
The **loanable** funds market is a hypothetical market that brings savers (people who want to lend) and borrowers (people with profitable investment opportunities) together.

For a closed economy, let's assume that there is only one type of loan, and as a result, only one interest rate in the economy. The nominal interest rate is determined in the market for loanable funds.

## Demands for Loanable Funds
The demand for funds comes from investment, since people with investment opportunities (mainly households and firms) need to borrow funds to finance their investment.

A few assumptions are made:
* Returns on investment projects are given and known
* Only investment projects with **positive net present value (NPV)** will be undertaken
* The **interest rate** represents the opportunity cost of investment.

Even those with the funds to build a project should be concerned with the interest rate, since they can lend out their funds to others, and obtain a higher return.

## Net Present Value
The **net present value** of an investment is defined as:
$$Net\ Present\ Value = Present\ Value\ of\ Return - Present\ Value\ of\ Cost$$
The present value of a project $n$ years in the future is calculated using the discount rate.
$$PV = \sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{Payment\ at\ time\ t}{(1+i)^t}$$
### Example
Suppose there is a bond with a face value of $\$1000$, a coupon rate of $8\%$, and a maturity of $4$ years. The cash flow of this 4-year bond is:
| | In 1 year | In 2 years | In 3 years | In 4 years |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cash flow|$\$80$|$\$80$|$\$80$|$\$1080$|

The present value is calculated as follows:
$$
\begin{align}
PV & = $80v^1 + $80v^2 + $80v^3 + $1080v^4\\
   & = \frac{$80}{(1+i)} + \frac{$80}{(1+i)^2} + \frac{$80}{(1+i)^2} + \frac{$1080}{(1+i)^4}
\end{align}
$$
For the following interest rates, the present value is:
| Interest rate, i | PV of the bond |
|---|---|
|6%|1069.3|
|8%|1000|
|10%|936.60|

Holding all else constant, an increase in the interest rate causes a decrease in the present value of the bond.

### Example
Supose you have an opportunity to invest in a project that costs $100 now. This project will give you a return of $120 in 3 years and after that there is nothing left.
| | Now | In 1 years | In 2 years | In 3 years |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cash flow|$-\$100$|$\$0$|$\$0$|$\$120$|

Whether this project is attractive depends on the interest rate.
|Interest rate, i| NPV|Profitable?|
|---|---|---|
|2%|$13.08|Yes|
|8%|-$4.74|No|

Holding all else constant, an increase in the interest rate makes investment less attractive. It causes a decrease in the present value of future payouts, lowering the level of investment activities.

There is an **inverse** relationship between the interest rate and investment.

## Shifts in Domestic Demand
Factors other than interest rate that affect investment, will shift the demand curve for loanable funds.

### Perceived Business Opportunities
Changes in the perceived business opportunites or future payoffs of investment. Suppose there is a new technological innovation in a particular field. Firms will need to undertake investment right now, in order to have the machinery/infrastructure to take advantage of it.

Firms find that investment becomes more attractive, because future $MP_k$ increases for any given level of interest $i$. The demand curve shifts to the right.![[Screenshot_20220609-161210_Obsidian.jpg]]
### Government Policies
Governments can provide a tax-credit on investments. The revenue of investment earned over a period, will pay a reduced amount of tax. As a result, the after tax return on investment increases, leading to an incentive to undertake investment.

This lowers the cost of investment, because undertaking investment becomes more attractive. For any given level of interest $i$, the level of interest increases. The demand for loanable funds shifts to the right.

## Supply of Loanable Funds
The supply of funds comes from **national savings**. Holding all else constant, an increase in the interest rate leads to an increase in the supply of funds.

Savers/lenders face a trade-off between current consumption and future consumption. Higher interest rates raise the cost of consumption today, while return on savings increases. As a result, people are willing to save more and $S_{national}$ increases.![[Screenshot_20220609-164232_Obsidian.jpg]]


## Shifts in Domestic Supply
Similarly to demand, any factors that affect national savings other than interest rate, will shift the supply curve of loanable funds.

### Savings Behaviour
Changes in private savings behaviour, such as households' wealth, causes a change in preference between present and future consumption. 

Suppose that households find the value of their homes increases. As a result, they feel that they are become richer, and increase current consumption. This leads to a reduction in national savings, and a leftward shift in the supply of funds.![[Screenshot_20220609-164836_Obsidian.jpg]]
### Government Budget Balance
Suppose that there is an increase in the government budget deficit ($S_{public}$ decreases). This results in a drop in national savings, for any level of interest rate $i$, causing a leftward shift in the supply of funds.

## Equilibrium Interest Rate
Just like any supply and demand market, loanable funds also has an equilibrium where supply meets demand. In other words, where investment is equal to national savings.

## Expected Inflation
The true cost of borrowing depends on the **real interest rate**. Factors such as inflation, erodes the purchasing power of money over time. However, we can only calculate the real interest rate when looking backwards at the level of inflation that took effect.

The vertical axis of the loanable funds market measures the **nominal** interest rate for a given expected future inflation rate, $\pi^e$. Along the demand and supply for fund curves, expected inflation is held fixed. Changes in $\pi^e$ will shift both curves.

Suppose the market believes the expected inflation rate, $\pi^e$ will increase by $x$ percentage points.

When there is an increase in the expected inflation rate for any quantiy of funds demanded:
* Borrowers are willing to pay higher nominal rates equal to the change in $\pi^e$ because the real cost of borrowing does not change
* Lenders need to demand higher nominal rates equal to the change in $\pi^e$, in order to supply the same quantity of funds and to maintain the real return on lending.
