# Money
In economics, when we say someone has a lot of money, it means that person holds **relatively large portions of the wealth** in money. It does not mean that person has a lot of wealth.

Money includes any assets that can be easily be used to purchase goods and services, and is the most liquid in the economy (i.e. can be easily converted to cash).

There are several measures of monetary aggregate (or monetary supply), depending on the kind of assets that will be counted:

| |M1+|M2|M2+|
|---|---|---|---|
|Currency in circulation (cash)|x|x|x|
|Chequable deposits at chartered banks|x|x|x|
|Chequable deposits at trust and mortgage loan companies, credit unions, and other near banks|x| |x|
|Personal deposits at chartered banks| |x|x|
|Non-personal demand and notice deposits at chartered banks| |x|x|
|Non-personal demand and notice deposits at near banks| | |x|
|Deposits and shares at credit unions| | |x|
|Life insurance company individual annuities| | |x|
|Money market mutual funds| | |x|

Money needs to satisfy the following functions:
1. **Medium of exchange** - Asset that people use to trade for goods and services.
2. **Double coincidence of wants** - Can trade for a good, without having a good that the other person wants
3. **Store of value** - Asset that allows us to store purchasing power
4. **Unit of account** - Commonly accepted measure people use to set prices and make economic calculations
