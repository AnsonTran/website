# Short-Run Supply Side Shocks
Suppose, for example, that the price of oil increases. What happens to the short-run aggregate supply?
* Increase in prices of oil
* Increase in the per-unit production cost
* Decrease in per-unit profit
* SRAS shifts to the left

This shifts the short-run equilibrium to point B, which causes:
* Reduction in output below full employment
* Increase in aggregate prices
* Increase in unemployment rate below natural rate of employment

Overall, this leads to both an increase in prices, and falling output, called **stagflation**.

## Maintain the Status Quo
If we do not apply any monetary policies, the economy will self adjust in the long-term:
* Since output is below full employment, there will be pressure for wages to fall
* Reduces per-unit production costs and increases per-unit production profit
* SRAS shifts to the right to its original spot

## Counter-Cyclical Stabilization Policy
To bring economic output back to full employment, policy makers can:
* Increase government spending
* Increase lump-sum transfers
* Decrease lump-sum taxes
* Increase money supply

This leads to an increase in autonomous expenditure, shifting the AD curve to the right. However, this causes a permanent increase in the aggregate price level.
