# Supply Side Shocks (SRAS & LRAS)
What happens when there is a shift in both the short-run and long-run aggregate supply? This might be caused by new production technology, i.e. an increase in the level of total factor productivity.
* Increases output levels at full employment
* LRAS shifts to the right
* Firms can produce more for the same amount of input
* Decreases per-unit production costs, increasing per-unit profit
* SRAS shifts to the right

This shifts the short-run equilibrium to point B, which causes:
* Increase in output levels
* Downwards pressure on price levels

## Maintain the Status Quo
If we do not apply any monetary policies, the economy will self adjust in the long-term:
* Since output is below full employment, there will be pressure for wages to fall
* Reduces per-unit production costs and increases per-unit production profit
* SRAS shifts even further to the right, to the long-run equilibrium
