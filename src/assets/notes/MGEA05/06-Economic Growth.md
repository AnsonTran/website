# Economic Growth
A common measure for long-run economic growth is real GDP per capita. It measures the value of the country's final products and income. Additionally:
* It ignores the effects of rising prices on the output
* Isolates the effect of changes in population on output

More importantly, we look at the rate of growth in real GDP per capita, as it tells us how fast income is changing over time.

## Sources of Long-Run Growth
Holding all else constant, these factors lead to an increase in real GDP, and an increase in output per worker.
* **Physical Capital** - Increase in factories, machines, infrastructure, etc. Allows the economy to produce more output
* **Human Capital** - More investment in education. A proxy measure of human capital is years of education. A more educated and/or experienced work force allows the workers to become more efficient.
* **Technological Progress** - Improvement in production technology, allowing the economy to produce more output for the same amount of inputs. 

## Measures of Long-run Growth
### The Rule of 70
The rule of 70 measures how many years $t$ it takes for a variable to double at growth rate $i$.
$$t = \frac{70}{i}$$

Derivation using the compound interest formula
$$(1+i)^t=2 \rightarrow t = \frac{ln(2)}{ln(1+i)}$$

### Output per Worker
Another measure of sustained economic growth is output per worker, also called average product of labour.
$$AP_L = \frac{RGDP}{\#\ of\ workers}$$

While real GDP per capita divides by the population, output per worker divides by the size of the labour force. In the long run, an increase in output per worker implies higher productivity.

### Aggregate Production Function
Summarizes the relationship among the level of output, production technology, and productive inputs.
$$Y = A\times F(K,L,H)$$
* Y - Aggregate real output (real GDP)
* A - Total factor productivity (TFP)
* K - Stock of physical capital
* L - # of labour used
* H - Stock of human capital

### Per Worker Production Function
Long-run growth is focused on output per worker, so we will focus on per-worker production function.
$$\frac{Y}{L}=\frac{A\times F(K,L,H)}{L}=A\times f(\frac{K}{L},\frac{H}{L}) \rightarrow y=A\times f(k,h) = Af(k,h)$$
* y - Real output per worker
* k - Physical capital per worker/ capital-labour ratio
* h - Human capital per worker

### Marginal Product
The per-worker production function takes the following form:
$$y=Ak^\alpha h^{(1-\alpha)},\ where\ 1>\alpha>0$$

Marginal product of capital is concerned with what happens to the real output, as we increase either physical or human capital.

**Marginal product of physical capital** is always positive. Adding physical capital will lead to an increase in production per worker.
$$MP_k=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta k}=\alpha Ak^{(\alpha-1)}h^{(1-\alpha)}=\alpha A(\frac{h}{k})^{(1-\alpha)}>0$$

**Marginal product of human capital** is always positive. Educating more workers will also lead to an increase in production per worker.
$$MP_h=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta h}=(1-\alpha) Ak^{\alpha}h^{-\alpha}=(1-\alpha) A(\frac{k}{h})^{\alpha}>0$$

However, looking at the history of economic growth, we observed that estimated per-worker production function shows **diminishing** marginal product of physical capital.
$$\frac{\Delta MP_k}{\Delta k}=\alpha(\alpha-1)Ak^{(\alpha-2)}h^{(1-\alpha)}<0$$

### Growth Accounting Function
In the long run, all productive inputs (capital, labour, and human capital) and total factor productivity are increasing. **Growth accounting** decomposes the sources of output growth into parts attributable to growth of capital, labour, and total factor productivity.

**Using the per-worker production function:
$$\frac{\Delta y}{y} = \frac{\Delta A}{A}+\alpha(\frac{\Delta k}{k})+(1-\alpha)(\frac{\Delta h}{h})$$
* $\frac{\Delta A}{A}$ - Total factor productivity growth
* $\alpha$ - Capital share of income
* $(1-\alpha)$ - Human capital share of income
* $\alpha(\frac{\Delta k}{k})$ - Contribution of capital
* $(1-\alpha)(\frac{\Delta h}{h})$ - Contribution of human capital

## Why Growth Rates Differ
### Savings and Investment Spending
Holding all else constant, output increases when the stock of physical capital increases. Since $\Delta K = I$, to accumulate capital stock, the economy needs to undertake investment.

Funds for investment can come from two sources:
1. **Domestic savings** - Savings done by households and government
2. **Foreign savings** - Savings from foreigners, borrowed from abroad

### Education
One way to build human capital is through investment in education. Countries tend to grow faster when they spend a large portion of their GDP on education.

### Research and Development
Spending to create and implement new technology. Countries that spend a higher portion of GDP on R&D tend to enjoy higher TFP growth because they are  more likely to experience technological breakthroughs.

According to the OECD, Canada spends $1.5\%$ on R&D. 

## Government Policies
Governments can affect the economy through economic policies, either hindering or promoting growth.
* **Infrastructure** - Lower the cost of building infrastructure through provision of subsidies or tax breaks. Increases the physical capital of the economy
* **Education** - Providing free or subsidized education. Leads to a more educated workforce, and an increase in human capital.
* **Research and Development** - Providing subsidies or tax credits for R&D. Likelihood of technological breakthroughs increases. Increases total factor productivity.

Additionally, governments can promote investment in the economy indirectly, by maintaining stability.
* **Financial System** - Maintaining a healthy and well-functioning financial system helps channel funds from saves to borrowers, so those who have profitable investment opportunities have the funds needed to finance their investment.
* **Property Rights** - Protect property and intellectual rights, in order for innovation to flourish. Without this, there is no incentive to innovate, since others can easily copy and capture the rewards. In Canada, patents are granted and administered by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office.
* **Good Governance** - Provide a stable environment for firms and individuals to undertake investment projects and R&D. Laws should be enforced fairly and consistently.
