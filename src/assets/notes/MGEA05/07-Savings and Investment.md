# Savings and Investment
Previously when discussing long-run economic growth, we noted that physical capital and human capital play important roles. In Canada:
* Human capital is largely provided by governments through public education
* Physical capital, with the exception of infrastructure, is mostly created by private investment spending (by firms and households)

Once we have a better understanding of how we can finance investment, we can understand how we accumulate physical capital over time.

## Savings-Investment Spending Identity
The savings-investment identity shows that investment **must** be equal to savings in the economy as a whole.
$$Investment\ =\ Savings$$

Investment represents the demand for funds, and savings represents the supply for funds.

## Disposable Income
Sum of income that a household takes in after taxes.
$$\text{Disposable Income (YD)=Output(Y)-Taxes(T)+Transfers(TR)}$$

>Transfers indicate things like child-care benefits, old age pensions, etc.

## Private Savings
Denoted $S_{private}$, is savings done by households. It's what's left from disposable income after consumption.
$$S_{private} = Disposable\ Income-Consumption(C)$$

## Public Savings
Denoted $S_{public}$, is savings done by all levels of government.
$$S_{public}=Taxes(T)-Transfers(TR)-Spending(G)=Government\ Budget\ Balance(GBB)$$

Government budget balance indicates whether we have a:
* Budget surplus - $GBB > 0$
* Budget deficit - $GBB < 0$
* Balanced budget - $GBB = 0$

## National Savings
The level of savings by the whole economy, denoted $S_{national}$. It is the amount of output not devoted to current consumption.
$$S_{national} = Y-C-G$$

National savings can also be defined as the sum of private and public savings.
$$
\begin{align}
S_{national} & = S_{private} + S_{public}\\
& = (Y-T+TR-C) + (T-TR-G)\\
& = Y-C-G
\end{align}
$$

## Capital Outflows
We purchase foreign assets or undertaking foreign investment. Funds exit our domestic economy.

## Capital Inflows
Foreigners purchase domestic assets or undertake investment in our country. Funds enter into our economy.

## Net Foreign Investment
The difference between capital outflows and inflows
$$NFI=Capital\ Outflows - Capital\ Inflows$$

Net foreign investment indicates the international flow of funds, while net exports indicates the international flow of goods and services. Any exchange of goods and services will come with a corresponding exchange of funds.
$$NFI = X - IM = NX$$

## Closed Economy Spending Identity
A closed economy is one that does not do any trading with foreigners. In other words, there are no exports and no imports.
$$X=0,\ IM=0\ (NX=0)$$

Recall the expenditure approach to calculating GDP. The national income identity for a closed economy is:
$$GDP=Y=C+I+G$$

>GDP measures the total level of output and total level of income at the same time, so these will be used interchangably.

For a closed economy, the only way for a country to save is to build up capital stock (i.e. undertake investment)
$$
\begin{align}
Y & = C+I+G\\
Y-C-G & = I\\
S_{national} & = I
\end{align}
$$

## Open Economy Spending Identity
An open economy engages in international trade and investment from foreigners
$$X\neq 0,\ IM\neq 0$$

An open economy can allocate savings in two ways:
* **Accumulate physical capital** - Undertaking domestic investment (I)
* **Acquiring foreign assets** - Undertaking foreign investment (NFI)

For an open economy, national savings is the sum of these two.
$$
\begin{align}
Y & = C+I+G+NX\\
Y-C-G &= I+NX\\
S_{national} &= I+NX\\
S_{national} &= I+NFI
\end{align}
$$
