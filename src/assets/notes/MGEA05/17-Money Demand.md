# Money Demand
Money demand comes from households and firms who want to facilitate daily transactions and/or storing their wealth.

## Opportunity Cost
Wealth can be stored in different types of assets:
* **Monetary assets** - Cash and bank deposits, offers convenience but offer little to no interest/return
* **Non-monetary assets** - Assets that produce interest, such as bonds, stocks, etc., offers returns to holders but takes time to convert into money

An interest rate increase raises the opportunity cost of holding money, so households and firms would like to hold more interest-bearing assets and fewer monetary assets.

## Money Demand Curve
Shows the relationship between quantity of money demanded and the interest rate. Given interest rate represents the opportunity cost of holding money, there is an inverse relationship between the quantity of money demanded and the interest rate.

Changes in factors other than interest rate will cause the MD curve to shift left or right.

### Rightward Shift
|Factor|Reason|
|---|---|
|Increase in aggregate price level|Prices increase, so we need to hold more money to buy the same amount of goods and services|
|Increase in real GDP|Output and consumption increases, so we need to hold more money to facilitate a larger volume of transactions|
|Institutional factors such as chequable-savings accounts|Convenience for depositors without giving up interest. Lowers opportunity cost of holding money|

### Leftward Shift
|Factor|Reason|
|---|---|
|Improvement in banking technology (credit cards)|Allows people to make purchases without holding money|

## Theory of Liquidity Preference
For the liquidity preference model, we make the following assumptions:
1. Only one interest rate paid for non-monetary financial assets
2. The (nominal) money demand comes from households and firms
3. The level of (nominal) money supply is chosen by the central bank
4. The BOC can change the money supply via open market operations, changing the bank rate, and deposit switching
5. Money market equilibrium is given by MS=MD. The interest rate adjusts to ensure the money market is in equilibrium.

### Excess Supply of Money
The quantity of money supplied is greater than the quantity of money demanded. As a result, people would like to convert their money into non-monetary, interest-bearing assets. This causes pressure for interest rates to drop.

### Excess Demand for Money
The demand for money is greater than the supply of money. So, some people would sell their interest-bearing assets and convert it into money, pushing up the interest rate.

### Increase in Money Supply
When money supply increases, the MS curve shifts to the right. This causes an excess supply of money, and causes the equilibrium interest rate to drop.

### Increase in Money Demanded
Suppose that output increases, leading to an increase in income and consumption. This shifts the MD curve to the right, and the equilibrium interest rates increases.

![[15.1-Theory of Liquidity Preference 2022-07-28 17.17.15.excalidraw]]

If the central bank has an inflation target that they wish to meet, they can increase the money supply through expansionary monetary policy. This would shift the MS curve to the right.

## Effects on AS-AD of Increase in Money Supply
Suppose the supply of money increases:
* **Short run** - A decrease in interest rate and an increase in autonomous expenditure shifts the AD-curve to the right
* **Long-run** - Output is above full employment, pressuring for wages to increase. This increases per-unit production costs, and lowers per-unit profits, shifting the SRAS curve to the left.

Notice above, that a change in money supply has no effect on the real output in the long run, called the **long-run neutrality of money**.

Recall the aggregate production function.
![[06-Economic Growth#Aggregate Production Function]]

Money supply does not enter the production function, so a change in money supply has no effect on output in the long run.

Another explanation for this, is that aggregate prices and input prices increase by the same proportion. Hence, there is no change in the real value of goods and services, and no change in AD.

## Quantity Equation
Shows the relationship between nominal GDP and the amount of money exchanged.
$$M\times Y=P\times Y$$
> $M$ - Money supply
> $V$ - Velocity of money
> $P$ - Aggregate price level
> $Y$ - Real GDP
> $M\times V$ - Total amount of money exchanged in a year
> $P\times Y$ - Nominal GDP
