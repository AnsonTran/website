# Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy refers to the government's choice regarding levels of spending, taxes, and transfers.

![[02-The National Account#^c1f75e]]

Fiscal policies can effect the aggregate expenditure in the following ways:
* **Government spending ($G$)** - Government spending is part of the national income identity, so it effects aggregate expenditure directly
* **Taxes, and Transfers ($T, TR$)** - Households split the change in disposable income $YD$ between consumption $C$ and savings. Changes in tax policy can also affect investment and the profitability of investment projects.

Changes in fiscal policy affect planned expenditure $AE_{planned}$, shifting the aggregate demand curve. This leads to changes in the short-run level of output. In [[11.2-Fiscal Policy Model|Fiscal Policy Model]], we look at the planned expenditure with these values being variable.

## Effectiveness of Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policies cause a shift in the $AD$ or $AE_{planned}$ curves. A fiscal policy is said to be:
* **Expansionary** - Leads to an increase in output, by doing some of the following:
	* Increase government spending
	* Decrease taxes
	* Increase transfer payments
* **Contractionary** - Leads to a decrease in output, by doing some of the following:
	* Decrease government spending
	* Increase taxes
	* Decrease transfer payments

## Government Spending Always Crowds Out Private Spending
**Argument**: Every dollar the government spends is a dollar taken away from the private sector. Any increase in government spending must be offset by an equal reduction in private spending.

This argument is true, but only if the economy is operating at full-employment. Otherwise, in a recessionary gap, expansionary fiscal policy works.

## Government Borrowing Always Crowds Out Private Investment Spending
**Argument**: Expansionary fiscal policy leads to:
* Lower public savings
* Decrease in supply of loanable funds
* Increase in interest rate
* Decrease in investment

Crowding out of investment is less likely to happen because when the economy is in a recessionary gap, an expansionary fiscal policy is likely to increase output/income. Given households only consume a portion of the income, national savings would increase and interest rate won't increase.

## Government Budget Deficits Lead to a Reduced Private Spending
**Argument**: Expansionary fiscal policy might lead to budget deficits. To finance the budget deficit, the government:
* Borrows from the public
* Increases the stock of national debt
* Raises taxes to pay off debt
* Households save more and spend less in expectation of higher taxes
* **Ricardian equivalence** - Expansionary fiscal policy has no effect on output 

Its unlikely that households will behave with such foresight and budgeting discipline. They might spread the reduction in consumption over a long period of time. Therefore, expansionary fiscal policy can still increase output by a smaller amount. It is less effective, but not completely ineffective.

## Fiscal Lag
The effects of fiscal policy takes time between decision and implementation. It takes time for:
* Government to realize a shock has hit the economy
* Government to develop a plan to respond to the shock
* Change in fiscal policy to impact the economy

This has a few implications:
* Its possible for the shock to be over by the time change in fiscal policy takes effect
* Changes in fiscal policy might lead to unnecessary fluctuations in output

## Cyclically Adjusted Budget Balance
The government budget can change based on the business cycle, without a change in fiscal policy. Hence, we should not assess the fiscal policy on budget balance alone.

The budget can be broken up into two components:
$$\begin{align}
GBB&=T-TR-G\\
&=(T_0+tY)-(TR_0-trY)-G)\\
&=(T_0-TR_0-G)+(t+tr)Y
\end{align}$$

Hence, the budget changes based on:
1. A deliberate change in fiscal policy, in $G,T_0,TR_0$
	* Affects the GBB directly
	* Affects the GBB indirectly via a change in $Y$, through a change in $AE_0$
2. A change in output (**endogenous component**)
	* Affects the GBB directly

## Deficits
Deficits can be split into two types:
* **Structural deficit** - The government runs a budget deficit even when the economy is at full employment (this is bad)
* **Cyclical deficit** - The budget is balance at full employment. The government runs occasional budget deficits when the economy is in a recession, which is normal.

Ideally, governments should run surpluses when output is above full employment, and deficits when output is below full employment.

## National Debt
Over the long-run budget deficits can have a negative effect on national debt. If we run a budget:
* **Surplus ($GBB>0$)** - National debt decreases
* **Deficit($GBB<0$)** - National debt increases

$$\begin{align}
National\ Debt_t&=National\ Debt_{t-1}-Government\ Budget\ Balance\\
\Delta National\ Debt_t&=National\ Debt_{t}-National\ Debt_{t-1}\\
&=-Government\ Budget\ Balance
\end{align}$$

## Rising Debts
Persistent budget deficits crowd out investment and lower long-run economic growth. It causes:
* Lower public savings
* Decrease in supply of loanable funds
* Increase in interest rate
* Decrease in investment
![[15-Fiscal Policy 2022-07-25 18.45.37.excalidraw]]
Budget deficits also lead to an accumulation of national debt. It causes:
* An increase in national debt to finance deficits
* Increase in funds to service debt, which could be used to run public programs
* Government cuts services, increase taxes, or both
* May default on debt if unsustainable (a sovereign debt crisis)

However, if budget deficits are due to spending on public investment such as education and infrastructure, deficits may be less worrisome since it would increase future productivity.
