# Simple Model
As an introduction to the income-expenditure model, we make a few assumptions to make things easier. Later on, we will relax these assumptions.

## Assumptions
Producers are willing to supply additional output at a **fixed price**. (A change in aggregate expenditure leads to a change in aggregate output)

Interest rate is held fixed
$$i=\bar{i}$$

Government spending, taxes, and transfers are given. Everyone receives the same lump-sum transfers.
$$G=\bar{G},T=T_0,TR=TR_0$$
> $T_0$ are lump-sum taxes, $TR_0$ are lump-sum transfers

Exports and imports are given.
$$X=X_0, IM=IM_0$$
> $X_0$ is autonomous exports, $IM_0$ is autonomous imports

## Planned Aggregate Expenditure
The planned aggregate expenditure (or planned expenditure) refers to the desired/planned level of spending by all sectors in the economy.
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=C+I_{planned}+G+X-IM\\
&=[AC+MPC(YD)]+[AI-(d\times i)]+G+X_0-IM_0\\
\end{align}$$
Since taxes and transfer payments are fixed, the disposable income becomes:
$$YD=Y-T+TR=Y-T_0+TR_0$$
Hence, the income-expenditure model becomes:
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=[AC+MPC(Y-T_0+TR_0)]+[AI-(di)]+G+X_0-IM_0\\
&=AC+MPC(Y)+MPC(T_0)+MPC(TR_0)+AI-di+G+X_0-IM_0\\
&=[AC+AI-di+G+X_0-IM_0+MPC(T_0)+MPC(TR_0)]+MPC(Y)\\
&=AE_0+MPC(Y)\\
\end{align}$$

Autonomous expenditure $AE_0$ summarizes all of the terms that are not dependent on the output.
$$AE_0=AC+AI-di+G+X_0-IM_0+MPC(T_0)+MPC(TR_0)$$ ^cfebd3

## Actual Expenditure
Actual expenditure (or national income) reflects the actual expenditure that took place in a given year.
$$\begin{align}
AE_{actual}=Y&=C+I_{actual}+G+X-IM\\
&=C+(I_{planned}+I_{unplanned})+G+X-IM\\
&=(C+I_{planned}+G+X-IM)+I_{unplanned}\\
&=AE_{planned}+I_{unplanned}
\end{align}$$

In the optimal case, firms undertake exactly the investment that they planned for, with nothing taking the firms by surprise. In other words, actual expenditure is exactly equal to the planned expenditure.
$$I_{unplanned}=0\Rightarrow AE_{actual}=AE_{planned}$$

## Equilibrium
Equalibrium in the income-expenditure model is defined as the level of output such that actual expenditure is equal to planned expenditure.
$$\begin{align}
GDP=Y&=AE_{planned}+0=AE_{planned}\\
&=AE_0+MPC(Y)\\
AE_0&=Y(1-MPC)\\
Y^*&=\frac{AE_0}{1-MPC}
\end{align}$$

## The Multiplier
Recall the income-expenditure we stated earlier:
![[11-Income-Expenditure Model#^5ea315]]

The multiplier measures the change in equilibrium output or income that results from a unit change in autonomous expenditure
$$M=\frac{\Delta Y^*}{\Delta AE_0}$$
From the income-expenditure model, we can derive the multiplier:
$$\begin{align}
Y&=AE_{planned}\\
Y^*&=\frac{AE_0}{1-MPC}\\
\Delta Y^*&=\frac{\Delta AE_0}{1-MPC}\\
\frac{\Delta Y^*}{\Delta AE_0}&=\frac{1}{1-MPC}=M\\
\end{align}$$
> $M$ is always greater than 1

Since the multiplier $M$ is greater than 1, one unit change in autonomous expenditure $AE_0$ leads to a greater than one unit change in the output.

This is because one person's spending is another person's income. The second person spends more on goods and services, increasing the income of the third person, etc. The multiplier summarizes the overall effect of the initial change in spending by person 1 on the total output.

## Example
Suppose a closed economy can be described as follows:

|Component|Value|
|---|---|
|Consumption|$C=58+0.8YD$|
|Investment|$I_{planned}=96-100i, \bar{i}=6\%$|
|Government Spending|$G=20$|
|(Lump-sum) Taxes|$T=T_0=15$|
|(Lump-sum) Transfers|$TR=TR_0=5$|

> Later on, we will relax some of the assumptions made here. The values will change, but these steps will remain the same.

1. Express the consumption function as a function of $Y$
$$\begin{align}
YD&=Y-T+TR\\
&=Y-15+5\\
C&=58+0.8(Y-10)\\
&=50+0.8Y\\
\end{align}$$

2. Derive the planned expenditure $AE_{planned}$ function
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=C+I_{planned}+G\\
&=(50+0.8Y)+(96-100(0.06))+20\\
&=160+0.8Y\\
&=AE_0+MPC(Y)
\end{align}$$

3. Solve for the equilibrium level of output
$$\begin{align}
Y&=AE_{planned}\\
&=160+0.8Y\\
0.2Y&=160\\
Y^*&=800
\end{align}$$
![[10-Income-Expenditure Model 2022-07-08 00.44.35.excalidraw]]

Consider what happens if the real output $Y=740<Y^*$.
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=160+0.8(740)\\
&=752\\
AE_{planned}+I_{unplanned}&=Y\\
I_{unplanned}&=740-752\\
I_{unplanned}&=-12\\
\end{align}$$
Firms find that their inventories are dropping unexpectedly. As a result, firms would respond by increasing production until $Y=AE_{planned}$ and $I_{unplanned}=0$.

Consider what happens if the real output $Y=860>Y^*$.
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=160+0.8(860)\\
&=848\\
AE_{planned}+I_{unplanned}&=Y\\
I_{unplanned}&=860-848\\
I_{unplanned}&=12\\
\end{align}$$
Firms find that they have excess inventory. As a result, they would decrease production until $Y=AE_{planned}$ and $I_{unplanned}=0$.
