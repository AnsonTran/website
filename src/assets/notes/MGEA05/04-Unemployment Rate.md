# The Unemployment Rate
Statistics Canada carries out a monthly survey called the Labour Force Survey, interviewing a random sample of 56,000 households across Canada.

Adult population (age 15 or above) are classified into 3 groups:
1. **Employed** - Those working either full or part time
2. **Unemployed** - People available for work, do not have a job, and are actively looking or a job during the past four weeks
3. **Not in the labour force (NILF)** - People who do not have a job and not looking for one

If you are a full-time student, but working part time, you may be placed in the NILF group, so as to avoid double counting.

### Labour Force (LF)
Attempts to capture those who are available for work, people who are working and are available for work.
$$LF=|Employed|+|Unemployed|$$
### Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR)
Percentage of adult population in the labour force
$$LFPR=\frac{\text{Labour Force}}{\text{Adult Population}}\times100\%$$
### Unemployment Rate (UR)
Percentage of the labour force that is unemployed
$$UR=\frac{|\text{Unemployed}|}{\text{Labour Force}}$$
### Employment Rate (ER)
Percentage of adult population that is employed
$$ER=\frac{|\text{Employed}|}{\text{Adult Population}}\times100\%$$
Unemployment and employment rate have different denominators, so they do not add up to 100%.

## Significance of the Unemployment Rate
The unemployment rate gives us a general picture of whats happening in the labour market (i.e. how easy or difficult it is to find a job given the current state of the economy).

Unemployment rate may **overstate** the true level of employment due to:
* **Fraudsters** - People who claim to be unemployed may not actually want to work, and could not find one. (i.e. to claim employment insurance)
* **Skilled workers** - Finding jobs takes time, even for experienced workers. We shouldn't worry about these people, because it's only a matter of time before they find a job.

Unemployment rate my **understate** the true level of employment due to:
* **Discouraged workers** - People may be discouraged from working, if they have given up looking due to an unsuccessful job search
* **Marginally attached workers** - Individuals may not currently working and have stopped searching, but because they are waiting for a job to begin.
* **Underemployed** - People may be working, but not in the their desired field or career.

## Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU)
The natural rate of unemployment is unemployment that is normal to the economy, and does not put pressure on the inflation rate. 
$$NRU = \frac{\text{Frictional Unemployment + Structural Unemployment}}{\text{Labour Force}}\times100\%$$
### Frictional Unemployment
Workers are **frictionally unemployed**, if they are currently looking for a job. This is never zero, because job searches take time.
* Some workers may leave their current job and look for a new one, if they are not satisfied with it.
* Workers may lose their jobs, if they are not performing well for their employer.

Low frictional employemtn is normal and may be good for the economy, because it allows workers to take their time finding jobs that best suit their skills.

### Structural Unemployment
Structural unemployment is caused by **excess supply of labour**, and **reduced labour demand** at a prevailing wage. It arises from rigidities in the labour market.

As we can see, $L_D^1$ denotes reduced demand, $L_S^1$ denotes excess supply, and the difference $L_S^1 - L_D^1$ is the structural umeployment.

Wage rigidities can be caused by:
1. **Minimum wages** - Minimum wage is said to be **binding**, if it is set greater than the equilibrium. If it is set lower than the equilibrium, it does not affect the supply and demand of labour.
2. **Labour unions** - Labour unions can bargain for wages higher than the equilibrium.
3. **Efficiency wages** - Firms can pay workers higher than the equilibrium wage, in order to increase productivity of works. It can increase profit, and minimize labour turnover.
4. **Government policy** - May be caused due of side effects of government policies. For example, *employment insurance*(EI) incentivizes people to turn down low paying jobs and wait for higher paying jobs to become available. They stay unemployed in the higher paid labour market.
5. **Mismatch** - Mismatch between the skills required by the employers and the skills possessed by the employee. They may have to acquire new skills before getting a new job, or refuse to do so.

### Factors Affecting NRU
Institutional factors affecting the NRU include the following:
1. **Young workers** - Data shows that young workers tend to have a higher unemployment rate. The NRU tends to be higher, if a large portion of the labour force is characterized by young workers.
2. **Labour market institutions** - Unions may demand higher than equilibrium wages, leading to structural unemployment. They can also bargain for better job security for their members, lowering the NRU.
3. **Employment agencies** - Employment agencies act as a middleman between workers and employers, facilitating the match between employers and workers. They help to reduce frictional unemployment.
4. **Technology** - Technological improvements lowers the demand for low-skilled workers, leading to higher NRU. They may have to accept lower wages.

Governmental policies affecting the NRU include the following:
1. **Minimum Wage** - Increase in (binding) minimum wages leads to excess supply in the labour market, and increased structural unemployment.
2. **Employment Insurance** - Allows unemployed workers to take a longer time to find a job, leading to higher frictional unemployment. Workers may also hold out for higher paying jobs, rather than accepting a lower paying job. They may refuce to leave the market that pays higher than equilibrium, increasing structural unemployment.
3. **Job Training** - Helps unemployed workers acquire skills employers are looking for. They may now look for jobs where the demand for labour is higher, lowering structural unemployment. 
4. **Employment Subsidies** - Provides financial incentives for workers to accept new jobs or for employers to offer jobs, lowering frictional unemployment.
