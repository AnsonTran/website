# Fiscal Policy Model
In this model, we relax some assumptions based on the government's [[14-Fiscal Policy|fiscal policy]]:

## Government Spending
Government spending on final goods and services is a constant.
$$G=constant$$

## Taxes
Taxes can depend on the level of output in the economy
$$T=T_0+(t\times Y)$$
> $T_0$ - Autonomous/lump-sum taxes
> $0<t<1$ - Tax rate

## Transfer Payments
Government transfers should be reduced as the economy improves.
$$TR=TR_0-(tr\times Y)$$
> $TR_0$ - Autonomous/lump-sum transfers
> $0<tr<1$ - Transfer benefit reduction rate

## Planned Expenditure
Suppose the interest rate is held fixed. The set of equations are given as:
* $C=AC+(MPC\times YD)$
* $T=T_0+(t\times Y)$
* $TR=TR_0-(tr\times Y)$
* $I_{planned}=AI-(d\times i)$
* $G$
* $X=X_0$
* $IM=IM_0$

The planned aggregate expenditure model becomes:
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=[AC+MPC(Y-T+TR)]+(AI-di)+G+X_0-IM_0\\
&=[AC+MPC(Y-(T_0+tY)+(TR_0-trY)]+(AI-di)+G+X_0-IM_x\\
&=[AC+MPC(Y-tY-trY-T_0+TR_0)]+(AI-di)+G+X_0-IM_x\\
&=[AC+MPC((1-t-tr)Y-T_0+TR_0)]+(AI-di)+G+X_0-IM_x\\
&=[AC+AI+G+X_0-IM_0+MPC(TR_0)-MPC(T_0)-di]+MPC(1-t-tr)Y\\
&=AE_0+MPC(1-t-tr)Y
\end{align}$$

## Equilibrium
Solving for the equilibrium of the income-expenditure model, we get:
$$\begin{align}
Y&=AE_0+MPC(1-t-tr)Y\\
Y-Y(1-t-tr)MPC&=AE_0\\
Y^*&=\frac{AE_0}{1-MPC(1-t-tr)}
\end{align}$$




Suppose we have the following equations:

|Component|Value|
|---|---|
|Consumption|$C=600+0.75YD$|
|Taxes|$T=120+0.15Y$|
|Transfers|$TR=400-0.05Y$|
|Investment|$I_{planned}=700-5000i, \bar{i}=2\%$|
|Government Spending|$G=500$|
|Exports|$X=280$|
|Imports|$IM=250$|

1. Express $YD$ as a function of $Y$
$$\begin{align}
YD&=Y-T+TR\\
&=Y-(120+0.15Y)+(400-0.05Y)\\
&=280+0.8Y\\
\end{align}$$
2. Express the consumption function as a function of $Y$
$$\begin{align}
C&=600+0.75YD\\
&=600+0.75(280+0.8Y)\\
&=810+0.6Y
\end{align}$$
3. Derive the planned expenditure $AE_{planned}$ function
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=C+I_{planned}+G+X-IM\\
&=(810+0.6Y)+(700-5000i)+500+280-250\\
&=2040+0.6Y-5000(0.02)\\
&=1940+0.6Y
\end{align}$$
4. Solve for the equilibrium level of output
$$\begin{align}
Y&=1940+0.6Y&[MPC(1-t-tr)=0.6]\\
0.4Y&=1940\\
Y^*&=4850
\end{align}$$
5. Solve for the multiplier
$$M=\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta AE_0}=\frac{1}{1-0.6}=2.5$$

## Change in Government Spending
Suppose the government increases its spending on final goods and services by 50 ($\Delta G=50$). Find the new equilibrium level of output.

Method 1: Find the new $AE_{planned}$ function and solve for new $Y^*$
$$\begin{align}
AE_{planned}&=(AE_0+\Delta G)+MPC(1-t-tr)Y\\
&=(1940+50)+0.6Y\\
&=1990+0.6Y\\
Y^*&=4975\\
\end{align}$$

Method 2: Use the multiplier to find the new $Y^*$
$$\begin{align}
\Delta Y^*&=\Delta AE_0\times M\\
&=50\times2.5\\
&=125\\
Y^*&=Initial\ Y^*+\Delta Y^*\\
&=4850+125\\
&=4975
\end{align}$$
## Automatic Stabilizers
Taxes and government transfers depend on income $Y$, so that they automatically change when income changes. This provides the economy with **automatic stabilizers**, which lowers the size of the multiplier, and helps to reduce the change in $Y^*$ for a given change in $AE_0$.

| Numerical example| The multiplier|
|---|---|
|$t=0,tr=0,MPC=0.75$|$M=\frac{1}{1-0.75(1)}=4$|
|$t=0.15,tr=0.05,MPC=0.75$|$M=\frac{1}{1-0.75(1-0.15-0.05)}=2.5$|

When $t>0$ or $tr>0$, the size of the multiplier decreases. For any given change in $AE_0$, the equilibrium level of output will change by a small amount.
