# Long Run Aggregate Supply Curve
The aggregate supply curve represents the quantity of output that producers are willing to supply at each aggregate price level.

## Assumptions
For the long-run aggregate supply curve, we make the following assumptions:
* Prices and wages are flexible in the long run (people have time to respond to the changes)
* The long-run level of output is determined by the aggregate production function.

The aggregate price level does not affect the quantity of aggregate supplied in the long run. As such, the supply curve is vertical.
