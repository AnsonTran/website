# International Capital Inflows/Outflows
In order to model the financial account, we make the following assumptions:
* It is a two-country world, Home (H) and Foreign (F)
* All international capital flows are in the form of loans
* Ignore effects of expected change in exchange rate on capital flows
* Perfect capital mobility (Money can move in/out of country whenever we want and in whatever amount)
* No risk premium (No fee in capital flow)
* Net Exports (NX) = Net Foreign Investment (NFI)

When the loanable funds market is in equilibrium:
* Sum of all countries' net exports must equal to zero.
* Sum of all countries' international flows of capital must equal to zero
* Domestic interest($i_H$)=Foreign interest($i_F$)=World interest($i_W$)

For an open economy, the supply of loanable funds comes from [[07-Savings and Investment#National Savings|national savings]].

$$SF=S_{National}=S_{Private}+S_{Public}$$

The demand for loanable funds comes from domestic investment, and is a function of opportunity cost $i$ of undertaking that investment 

$$DF=I(i)$$
> $i$ - Opportunity cost of undertaking investment

Suppose that two closed economies Home ($H$), and Foreign ($F$) are two closed economies, that have decided to trade on the open market.
* Initially, the interest rate in $H$ is greater than in $F$
* $H$'s assets are more attractive
* $H$ exports assets to $F$
* $H$ experiences capital inflows
* Quantity of funds available in $H$ increases, decreasing $i_H$
* Quantity of funds available in $F$ decreases, increasing $i_F$
* Repeats, until $i_H=i_F=i_W$.
* Capital inflows in $H$ = Capital outflows in $F$
