# Short Run Aggregate Supply Curve
The aggregate supply curve represents the quantity of output that producers are willing to supply at each aggregate price level.

## Assumptions
For the short-run, we make the following assumptions:
* Prices and wages are sticky in the short run. This is because of **menu costs** (cost of changing the output price), and **long-term contracts** where employee wages will not adjust for a period of time (2-3 years).
* Holding all else constant, producers are willing to supply more goods and services in the short run when the aggregate price increases. 

The short run aggregate supply curve is defined as:
$$P=(a+bY)(\frac{W}{\bar{W}})$$
> $a$ is a constant
> $b$ is greater than 0
> $\bar{W}$ is greater than 0
> $W$ is wages

To plot the aggregate supply curve, we hold $a,W$ fixed. The curve is upwards sloping.

## Shifts of Short-run Aggregate Supply
Factors other than $P$ or $Y$ will cause a shift of the short-run aggregate supply curve.

Producers' willingness to supply is determined by their per-unit profit:
$$\text{Per-unit profit}=\text{Per-unit output price}-\text{Per-unit production cost}$$

Any factors that increases per-unit profit other than the output price will cause a shift of the short-run aggregate supply curve to the right.

|Factors|Why|
|---|---|
|Decrease in commodity prices|Per-unit production costs decrease|
|Decrease in nominal wages|Per-unit production costs decreases|
|Increase in productivity|Per-unit production costs decreases|
