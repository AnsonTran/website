# Income-Expenditure Model
The income-expenditure model is a simple model of output determination, that shows us that a change in autonomous expenditure ($AE_0$) would lead to a chain reaction on the economy, such that output will change more than the initial change in autonomous expenditure.

## Autonomous Expenditure
The desired level of spending by all sectors in the economy (households, firms, government, and the rest of the world) that is not affected by the level of real GDP.

The ultimate change in output ($Y$) for a given change in autonomous expenditure ($AE_0$) is:
$$\Delta Y=M\times\Delta AE_0$$ ^5ea315
> M is a multiplier that reflects how sensitive the level of output is to the autonomous expenditure
