# Fixed vs. Variable Space
For multiprogramming systems, we need to allocate memory to competing processes. We need to determine how much memory to give to each process, i.e. how many pages a process has access to.

Fixed Space Algorithms:
* Each process has a limited number of pages it can use
* When it reaches a limit, it replaces from its own pages
* Local replacement - some processes may do well while others suffer

Variable Space Algorithms:
* Process' set of pages grows and shrinks dynamically
* Global replacement - one process can ruin it for the rest
* Local replacement - replacement and set size are separate

## Working Set Model
A working set of a process is used to model the dynamic locality of its memory usage.

WS(t,delta) = {pages P such that P was referenced in the time interval (t,t-delta)}

t = time, delta = working set window (measured in page refs)

It's hard to determine delta, and when the working set chages. Working set isn't used in practice, but useful as an abstraction.

## Page Fault Frequency (PFF)
Page fault frequency monitors the fault rate of each process.
* If the fault rate is above a high threshold, we give it more memory
* If the fault rate is below a low threshold, we take away memory

PFF is dificult to distinguish between changes in locality and size of working set

## Thrashing
Thrashing occurs when the OS spends more time paging data back and forth from disk than executing user programs.

In this situation, the system is overcommitted.
* No idea which pages should be in memory to reduce faults
* Could just be that there isn't enough physical memory for all of the processes in the system

Some solution to thrashing:
* Swapping - write out all pages of a process and suspend it
* Buy more memory
