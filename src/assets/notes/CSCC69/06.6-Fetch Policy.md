# Fetch Policy
Fetch policy determines when and which pages to fetch from the hard disk to memory when a page fault occurs.

### Demand Paging

Demand paging pulls a page back from swap when a page fault occurs. Every time a fault occurs, we pull only one page at a time, so it may be inefficient.

### Prepaging (aka Prefetching)

Prepaging pulls additional pages from swap, in anticipation that the process may need it soon.
