# Protection
File systems need to determine what happens when:
* one process reads while another writes
* two processes open a file for writing

A protection system is used to dictate whether given **action** by a given **subject** on a given **object** should be allowed.

Different types of access:
* None
* Knowledge
* Execution
* Reading
* Appending
* Updating
* Changing Protection
* Deletion

Unix provides only read/write/execute permissions. We can list permissions of files in the current working directory with:
```c
ls -l
```

## Representing Protection
**Access Control Lists (ACL)**:   For each object, maintan a list of subjects and their permitted actions
* ACLs are easier to manage, grant, and revoke permissions. We have to keep track of all subjects that have the capability
* ACLs can become very large if objects are heavily shared.

**Capabilities**:   For each subject, maintain a list of objects and their permitted actions
* Capabilities are easier to transfer between users.
