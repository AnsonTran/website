# Non-preemptive Scheduling
In non-preemptive scheduling, once the CPU is allocated a process, it keeps the CPU until it terminates. This type of scheduling is suitable for batch scheduling.

## First Come First Serve
Scheduler chooses the process at the head of the queue of ready processes.
* Average waiting times are often quite long
* May cause a **convoy effect**, where all processes need to wait for a big process to release the CPU.

In this example:
* B waits 2 cycles
* C waits 6 cycles
* In total, 8 cycles of waiting
* On average, 2.66 cycles

## Shortest Job First
Instead of choosing the first process in the queue, scheduler chooses the shortest job first.

Reduces the waiting times dramatically, compared to FCFS.

However, we need to know processing times in advance, which can be difficult. Long processes can be starved, if there are always new shorter jobs joining the queue.

In this example:
* B waits 3 cycles
* C waits 1 cycle
* In total, 4 cycles of waiting
* On average, 1.33 cycles
