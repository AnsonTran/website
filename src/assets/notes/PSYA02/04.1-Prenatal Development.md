# Prenatal Development
Three states of prenatal development
1. Germinal (0-2 weeks)
    * Period of the zygote (one-celled fertilized egg)
    * Zygote travels through the fallopian tube
    * Defined as 0-2 weeks gestational age (conception until implantation)
2. Embryonic (3-8 weeks)
    * Begins when zygote implants in the wall of the uterus
    * Cell differentiation - skins cells, muscle cells, etc.
3. Fetal (9 weeks - birth)
    * Skeleton and muscles develop, allowing movement
    * Brain development occurs rapidly, allowing detection of and learning from early experiences
    * Neurogenesis and myelination

**Exogenous experience**: Experience that comes from outside the organism
* Tastes, smells, sound, tactile sensation are exogenous mostly exogenous for fetuses

**Endogenous stimulation**: Stimuli generated by the organism itself

**Fetal Vision**
* Very little light coming into the womb
* Endogenous firing of cells to allow sense of sight to develop

**Fetal Audition**
* Heartbeat changes in reaction to external voices being played
* Different reaction to music than to human speech
* Newborns recognize mother's language and voice

**Fetal Olfaction**
* 3-day old neonates turn their heads longer toward familiar amniotic fluid
* Babies respond better to food that mothers ate

**Teratogens**
* External agents that cause damage/death during prenatal development
* Alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, etc.
* Raw fish (mercury)
* Polution and fumes

**Cascading Sensitive Periods**
* Sensitive periods of development where teratogens most affect fetuses
* Periods where many sensitive periods overlap

**Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder**
* Alcohol enters blood stream before being fully metabolized by the mother
* Most severe complications:
    * Facial deformities
    * Intellectual disability
    * Attention disability
    * Behaviour disorders

## Birth
* Babies spend 2/3 of a day sleeping
* Time spent sleeping goes down as people age
* Time spent crying about 2 hours and increases to a peak at about 6 weeks
* Most non-communicative until older
* *Can* be due to hunger, discomfort, pain, overstimulation
