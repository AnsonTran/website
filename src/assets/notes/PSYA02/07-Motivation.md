# Motivation
Psychological reason for producing an action, primarily driven by emotion.

Emotion changes actions by giving us information about an object, event, or
individual. Also provides instructions on what to do with new information.

**Hedonic principle**: All motivation extends from attraction to pleasure and
avoidance of paint. Our primary motivator, for **everything** is pleasure. We
do unpleasant activities to achieve this pleasure goal.

## Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation
**Intrinsic motivation**: motivation to take actions that are themselves rewarding. Eating chips, ice cream, etc.

**Extrinsic motivation**: motivation to take actions that eventually lead to a separate reward. Studying for a test to get a high mark, working a job to buy stuff

Extrinsic motivations tend to be weak in early childhood and among non-human animals.

## Approach vs Avoidance Motivation
**Approach motivation**: motivation to experience a **positive** income

**Avoidance motivation**: motivation to not experience a **negative** outcome

Generally, avoidance motivation tends to be stronger (evolutionary survival). However, it may differ across individuals.
