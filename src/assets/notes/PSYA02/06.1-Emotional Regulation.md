# Emotional Regulation
Emotional regulation is a somewhat learned strategy. Adults are good at regulating emotions, younger children are not. There are several factors:
* Internal feeling state (how we feel)
* Emotion-related cognitions
* Emotion-related physiological processes
* Emotion-related behaviour

Much is related to **temperament**
* Levels of emotionality(positive/negative)
* Ability to self-regulate emotion
* Predominantly biologically based

Infant strategies (begins to appear after 6 months):
* **Gaze aversion**
* **Self-soothing**

Strategies:
* **Distraction** by thinking/doing something else from experiences (more often negative stimuli)
* **Suppression** of negative thoughts
* **Affect Labelling**, naming emotional experiences
* **Re-appraisal**, think of emotion-inducing stimulus in a different way
