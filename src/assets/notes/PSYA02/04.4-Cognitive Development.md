# Cognitive Development
At the same time perceptual and motor abilities develop, children learn to think about the world around them.

**Jean Piaget**, Swiss psychologist pioneered understanding of cognitive development by dividing it into stages
1. Sensorimotor (0-2 years)
    * Infants rely on sensual and motor movements to learn about the world
2. Pre-operational (2-6 years)
    * Move from **egocentrism** to **sociocentrism** (from only own perspective to others)
    * Develop **theory of mind** - understanding behaviour guided by mental representations
3. Concrete operational (6-11 years)
4. Formal operational (11 years - adulthood)

Progress from stage to stage as they gain knowledge about the world around them

Acquire knowledge about some domain
Organize into a **schema/framework**
Acquire some new knowledge
Fit understanding?
    **Assimilation**: Add to existiing framework 
Doesn't fit understanding?
    **Accomodation**: Modify schema heavily, or create new schema

Piaget Criticisms
* Underestimated abilities of infants and young children.
    * Infants have trouble with language abilities
    * Are able to look in the right direction when done non-verbally
* Stages suggest there is some kind of 'overnight switch'
    * Development is continuous
* Underestimated how sociocentric infants are
    * Infants follow gaze of caregivers (shared attention)

### Attachment
Emotional bond with caregivers (attachment figure). Individual differences in attachment measured by:
* Extent to which an infant uses caregiver as a **secure base**
* How infant reacts to **reunion** with caregiver after short separations


### Strange Situation Procedure
~~~~
Mother plays with baby
Stranger enters room
Mother leaves
Stranger tries to play with baby
Mother comes back (reunion)
~~~~
* **Secure Attachment**: Most advantageous for babies moving forward
* **Insecure Attacmhemnt**:
    * **Avoidant**: Not concerned with mother when in room, avoids mother in reunion
    * **Resistant/Ambivalent**: Running toward mother, then acting angrily towards mother when mother tries to comfort
    * **Disorganized**: Fear behaviour/involuntary movement. Experienced some trauma
**Attachment style** predicts:
* Academic achievement
* Emotional health
* Relationship quality
* Self-esteem
