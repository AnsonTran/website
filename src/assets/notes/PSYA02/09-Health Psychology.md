# Health Psychology

**Stress** is a physical and psychological response to internal or external stressors.

**Stressors** are specific events or chronic pressures that place demands on a person or threaten well-being.

**Health Psychology** is a subfield of psychology that examines the relationship between physical health and psychological health.

There is a high correlation between physical illness and psychological stress. Not separate from one another, but intricately interwoven.

It is an evolved response to threat. When we're stressed:
* Adrenal glands are activated
* Increase heart and respiration rate -> more oxygen in the blood stream
* Increase in coritsol, more 

## Stress Scales
Stress scales operate by summing points for various stressful life events.
* [The Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale](http://bit.ly/28XuQEq)
	* Designed for people of adult age. Older than CUSS and has more data behind it.
	* Developed by taking a list of life events, and having patients self-report stressful events (What was the event, how many times has it happened in the last year).
	* Compared results with the patient's mental health.
	* Purely correlations, not causation
* College Undergradute Stress Scale
	* Version of the Holmes and Rahe, designed for people at college-going age

These scales are used to predict physical health problems. Each life event is assigned some life point value.

Stress scales have been tested for validity in multiple populations. Some events are more or less stressful in some cultures than in others.
* Divorce rate is very high in North American countries. In other countries, it may be less culturally accepting to get divorced.
* Stress of a pregnancy. More stressful in an unexpected or unwelcome pregnancy.


## Chronic Stress
Many individuals suffer from **chronic stressors**, such as being crammed in a crowded bus. Stressors that we experience in (maybe) small amounts, but repeated and long term. Chronic stress often grater physical harm than one-time stressors.

Repeated long-term stress changes the way we deal with stress. However, it causes constant stress response. Can result in **general adaptation syndrome**.
1. Alarm phase - initial, healthy reaction to stress
2. Resistance phase - body adapts to high stress; non-stress-related processes are shut down
3. Exhaustion phase - body cannot cope with other processes being shut down; illness, injury, or death can occur

One example would be having to pull multiple all-nighters to study. It's healthy to pull one all nighter and then sleep after the exam, but doing so for a long time is unhealthy.

## Control
A life event may be more stresful to a person than another life vent. We are more stressed by events we **cannot** control. 

**Glass and Singer**  
Two groups placed in a room and asked to complete difficult puzzles, with intermittent, unpredictable loud noise.
* One group were not able to turn off the noise
* Another group had a button they could hit to turn off the noise, but asked not to

Noisy group without control suffered in performance.

## Appraisal
How we interpret something and determine what kind of stress it is.

![spider-appraisal](spider-appraisal.png)

* Primary appraisal - determining whether stimulus is a threat
* Secondary appraisal - determining whether you can handle a stressor
	* Control over it?
	* Coping mechanisms to deal with it? (able to run away or stuck in a room)

## Coping
1. Repressive Coping - Avoid situations or thoughts that remind us of a stressor. Includes artifically positive viewpoints (pretending things are better than it is). For some people, it works well for them. Others find it challenging and make the problem worse
	* going to sleep to avoid stressor
	* watching netflix
	* listening to music
2. Rational Coping - Facing the stressor and working to overcome it. Opposite of repressive coping.
	1. Acceptance - realize stressor cannot be wished away
	2. Exposure - attending to stressor, seeking it out
	3. Understanding - working to find the meaning of stressor in your life

## Reframing
Changing the way one thinks about a stressor.

1. Stress Inoculation Training - Developing repetitive, positive ways to think about a stressor
	* Training yourself to repeat positive thoughts when encountering stressor
2. Meditation - Less cognitive and more physical. Involves absense of thought, or focusing on one, unstressful thought. 
	* Changes way our brains are structured
	* Increases myelination (speed and efficiency of processing)
	* Increased connectivity of areas of rational thought and emosion
	* suggests expert meditators are better able to regulate emotion


## Health Risk Affecting Behaviours
Two kinds of behaviours that affects your health risks
1. Active health risk requires you to DO the behaviour, such as smoking, biking. 
2. Passive health risk are you NOT doing a recommended health beaviour, such as washing hands, using hand sanitizer, etc.
