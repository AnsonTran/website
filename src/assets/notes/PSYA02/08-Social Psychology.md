# Social Psychology
Social psychology studies the causes and consequences of being social. Humans are considered ultrasocial animals. Some other ultrasocial animals are:
* ants and bees
* termites
* naked mole rats

Ultrasocial animals form large societies, divide labour, and cooperate for mutual benefit.

## Aggression
Aggression is the behaviour with the purpose of harming another. Can be another member of the same species or towards another species.

All humans aggress, some are more likely than others to do so. Based on some factors:
* biological factors:
	* genetics
	* sex - males are overall more aggressive than females
	* testosterone levels
* environmental factors
	* culture
	* societal expectations

Males are on the whole more aggressive than females.

Males are more physically aggressive than they are relationally aggressive.

Females are more relationally aggressive than they are physically aggressive.

Aggression is **evolutionarily adaptive**. However, aggression has decreased significantly in the last century.

Because of the short time that aggression has decreased, it suggests that there is another factor other than evolution that affects aggression Certain cultures are far more (or less) violent than others.
* scarcity of resources
* gender equality


### Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis
Animals aggress against another animal when their desires are frustrated.

Some argue that this hypothesis is too narrow. For example, people are more likely to aggress on hot days/months. Murder rates go up, pitches are more likely to hit the batter, etc.

Others argue that this can also be reduced to the frustration-aggression hypothesis. People want to have a good day, and the heat gets in the way.

### Testosterone
Testosterone does not appear to directly cause aggression. It appears to decrease and individuals' **threat assessment**. People with more testosterone are less afraid of retaliation.

## Cooperation
Behvior where two or more individuals work together that leads to mutual benefit. Cooperation is another way of solving our scarcity of resources.

We don't cooperate all the time because cooperation is risky. Sometimes people take advantage of other people's cooperation (working with someone in a group project who doesn't pull their own weight). Or, a group member having a different goal in mind (to sabotage the group).

To minimize the risk, we cooperate in groups. Collections of people that have something in common that distinguishes them from others. i.e. families, teams, religions, ethnicities, nations, etc.

Tend to have **positive prejudices** and exhibit **positive discrimination** toward members of our in-group.

Group cognition is deeply enrained in human evolution
* present in non-human primates
* arises in early childhood
* can be caused spontaneously and arbitrarily (people with same color shirts, arm band color, sports teams)

## Ingroup/Outgroup biases
We often have in-group and out-group beliefs we're not aware of, called **implicit biases**. Can affect behaviours, cognitions, and emotions in subtle ways.

[Implicit Association Test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/canada/takeatest.html) is a way to measure these biases. It asks you to categorize things in a binary way. Instead of asking you about your biases directly, it measures your reaction time to categorizing things. Humans are slower at processing information that conflicts with our cognition.

## Group cognition
Groups make cooperation less risky, but groups also have risks to decision making:
* **Common Knowledge Effect** - Instead of talking about a topic that a small subset of the group are familiar with, groups will talk about more common topics that can be discussed with everyone in the group.
* **Group Polarization** - Groups can make decisions that are more extreme than any member would have made alone. If a group of scared people are together, they become even more scared by talking to each other.
* **Deindividuation** - Groups cause people to be less concerned with personal values. Gang member could do some action that they would not have committed if they were alone, but they become less concerned with consequences when they are together.
* **Groupthink** - Decisions in groups take a long time, debating back and forth, and sharing ideas. They can reach a concensus too early, to get it over with, or peer pressure from vocal members of the group.
* **Diffusion of Responsibility** - Individuals feel diminished responsibility for their actions when surrounded by others acting the same way. If there is a car crash, you may drive past thinking 'someone else will just help them'

Group cognition is thought to have evolved to help us survive from scarcity of resources. We think that people outside the group will steal resources from the group. As we have more resources than we need, hopefully our ingroup bises will subside, which seems to be the case historically.

## Altruism
Altruism is behaviour that benefits another without benefitting oneself. In any case that may seem like altruism, there can be arguments that argue against it being a case of altruism.

If someone gives a dollar to a homeless person, one can argue that the person giving receives societal benefits (oh wow look at me, im such a nice person).

In non-human animals, we see altruism in:
* **Kinship Selection** - taking care of related kin, to increase likelihood of their genetic material being passed on
* **Reciprocation** - protecting another, with expectation that the favour will be returned

We would not call this true altruism however, because there is some kind of way of benefitting them.


## Selectivity
Humans are **selective** in terms of their sexual partners. Women more so than men, perhaps for:
* Biological reasons - Men can reproduce almost any time (sperm count), but women only about once a year.
* Societal pressure - Societally, men are expected to approach, while women are to be approached.

Selectivity is based on some factors:
* Physical Attraction
	* Varies from culture to culture
	* Beauty is universally beneficial
	* First thing we notice
* Situational Attraction
	* We try hard to like people that we are around
	* Tend to befriend people we have to spent a lot of time with (Mere Exposure Effect)
	* Especially in **psychologically arousing** situations (on a shaking bridge)
	* Perhaps the greatest factor in attraction
* Psychological Attraction
	* Easy to interact with people who are similar
	* Makes us feel confident that we are right
	* People more similar to us also *like* us more
	* Data shows "opposites attract" don't hold

## Social Influence
We all engage in (the attempt to) control other individuals

### Hedonic Motivation
Control people by appealing to their hedonic desires. Includes actions such as:
* Giving bonuses to hard working employees
* Rewarding children with snacks
* Government fines/jail sentences

Can backfire, if we convert some intrinsic motivation (kids who enjoy drawing), into extrinsic motivation (get a prize if you do).

### Approval Motivation
Appeal to an individuals desire for approval. We are motivated to have others like us and approve of us.

We follow the norms, as it makes us more likable (normative influence), but causes us to conform to the behaviour of others.
