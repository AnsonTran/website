# Disorders
## Anxiety Disorders
Anxiety disorder can be divided into two components, fear and anxiety.

**Fear**: Automatic emotional response experienced when faced with a threatening stimulus.

**Anxiety**: Anticipation of a negative stimulus.

Fear and anxiety are adaptive reactions to threats. It is typical to be fearful of a hungry lion, or anxious about an upcoming exam.

However, anxiety becomes a problem when it interferes with normal functioning (maladaptive), and decreases our fitness for survival.

This pathological anxiety can be classified as one of many anxiety disorders. They are very common (estimated 30% of people in Canada will experience one, although only about 5% of people are ever diagnosed).

## Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Generalized Anxiety Disorder is an anxiety disorder in which worries are not focused on any specific threat. Anxiety about many different things. People with GAD report that even though there isnt anything in their life particularly stressful, their anxiety seems to find something to settle on.

Diagnostic Criteria:
1. Excessive anxiety and worry, occur more days than not for at least 6 months, about more than one event/stressor.
2. Individual finds it difficult to control the worry.
3. Three or more of these symptoms:
	* Restlessness
	* Fatigue
	* Concentration deficiency
	* Irritability
	* Muscle tension
	* Sleep disturbance
	* The three common criteria for all psychological disorders

Onset of GAD rarely occurs prior to adolescence.
* Median age for dignosis is age 30.
* Many patients report having anxiety symptoms for a long time before reporting them.
* In the population level, level of anxiety is constant throughout the lifespan. No age group where anxiety is higher than in other age groups.
* In the individual level, severity of symptoms waxes and wanes across the lifespan
* Content of worries change (report card, mortgage, life span)
* Full remission (symptom free) is rare

## Phobic Disorders
Disorder characterized by marked, persistent, excessive fear of **specific** objects, activities, or situations. Person usually recognizes the irrationality of their fear, but cant control it.

* Specific phobia (12% prevalance)
	* Animals (dogs, cats, spiders, snakes)
	* Natural environments (earthquakes, darkness)
	* Situations (elevators, enclosed spaces)
	* Medical events (blood, injections, injury)
	* Other (loud noises, costumed characters, choking)
* Social phobia (13% prevelance)
	* Maladaptive fear of being publicly humiliated or embarassed

**Preparedness Theory**: We may be evolutionarily adapted to fear certain types of stimulus. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from **conditioning** (Monkeys can easily be conditioned to fear snakes, but not flowers). These fears may be overdeveloped in some individuals.

## Panic Disorders
Feelings of panic are normal when faced with immediate, life-threatening danger. But many individuals experience panic even when not in danger.

Panic disorder is the sudden occurence of multiple psychological and physical symptoms typically associated with terror including:
* shortness of breath
* heart palpitations
* sweating
* dizziness
* derealisation (feeling that the world is unreal)
* fear of death/losing one's mind

Panic episodes are relatively common.
* About 1/3 of Canadians experience a panic attack once or more per year, typically during extreme stress
* To be diagnosed, an individual must experience
	* recurrent, unexpected attacks
	* significant fear of another attack

## Mood Disorders
Mood is an emotional state that is
* long-lasting
* non-specific
* not caused by a particular stimulus
* affects our behaviour, cognition, and emotions

Mood disorders are well-known. They have mood distubance as their prominent feature. 

## Depressive disorders
* 22% female and 14% male Canadian population
	* Hormonal differences
	* Higher diagnoses
	* Different coping strategies (including sharing and co-rumination)
* About 1 in 12 Canadians will experience major depression in their lives
* Sometimes depression lasts for a long time

## Major depressive disorder (unipolar depession)
Most well-known depressive disorder. Severely depressed mood and/or inability to experience pleasure that lasts two or more weeks and is accompanied by feelings of worthlessness, lethargy, sleep disturbance, and/or appetite disturbance.

Diagnostic Criteria:
1. Five or more of the following symptoms present during the same 2-week period
	* Depressed mood
	* Diminished interest
	* Significant weight loss/gain
	* Insomnia or hypersomnia
	* Psychomotor agitation or retardation
	* Fatigue
	* Feelings of worthlessness/guilt
	* Diminished concentration/decisiveness
	* Recurrent thoughts of death/suicidal ideation
2. No evidence of a **manic** episode (abnormal, persistent high mood)
3. Symptoms cause clinically significant distress/impairment
4. Not better described by another DSM disorder
5. Not attributable to another medical condition or physiological effects of substance use.

Onset: May appear at any age, but is more likely to appear in the 20s

Prognosis:
* 2/5 of individuals recover within 3 months
* 4/5 of individuals recover within 1 year
* 1/5 of individuals do not experience remission

Risk factors:
* Temperamental (particularly neuroticism, or negative affect)
* Environmental (childhood experiences, stressful life events)
* Biological (neurotransmitter imbalance)
* Genetic (family members of individuals with MDD are 2-4 times more likely to be diagnosed with MDD; ~40% heritability)

Comorbidity:
* Substance-related disorders, panic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa

Psychological factors can affect an individual's susceptibility to depression. Many theorists argue that it is the way we think about things that cause depression, rather than the things themselves.

**Helplessness Theory**: The way a person thinks about failure makes them more or less likely to be depressed.
* Attribute failures to internal characteristics
* Believe that failures are permanent (stable)
* Believe that failures are global (apply to many areas of life)

## Dysthymia/Double Depression
Moderate depressive symptoms that last for more than two years are referred to as **dysthymia** or **dysthymic disorder**

When dysthymia is puntuated by episodes of major depression, it is called **double depression** (both at the same time).

## Bipolar Disorder
When we were talking about depressive orders, we called them **unipolar**. They were on one pole, specifically the negative pole.

Bipolar disorders are characterized by cycles of abnormal, persistent high mood (mania) and low mood (depression).

**Bipolar 1 disorder** - at least one manic episode, possibly with hypomanic (hypo meeaning below) and depressive episodes as well

**Bipolar 2 disorder** - presence of both hypomanic and depressive episodes; no manic episodes.

Diagnostic Criteria:
1. Distinct period of abnormal, persistenly elevated mood; increased activity or energy; lasting at least 1 week (manic episode)
2. Three or more of the following
	* Inflated self-esteem
	* Decreased need for sleep
	* Talkative
	* Racing thoughts
	* Distractibility
	* Increase in goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation
	* Excessive involvement in activities with high potential for painful consequences (driving fast, thrill seeking)

Prevalance:
* 1 in 40 individuals
* Not different between women and men (1.1:1 ratio)

Onset:
* Mean age of first episode = 18 years
* Onset can occur for the fist time in the 60s and 70s

Prognosis:
* 90% of individuals who experience a manic episode will experience more of them throughout life
* Full remission is very rare

Risk factors:
* Genetic (among most heritable disorders; coincident among identical twins 40-70%)
* Environmental (high stress, highly emotionally expressive family members; separation/divorce)
* Psychological (high neuroticism, high conscientiousness)

Comorbidity:
* Anxiety disorders
* Substance use disorders
* Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
* Behavioural disorders

## Personality Disorder
Unusual patterns of behaviour (relative to one's cultural context) that are maladaptive, distressing to oneself or others, and resistant to change.

There are three different clusters of personality disorders:
1. Odd/Eccentric
2. Dramatic/Emotional/Erratic
3. Anxious/Fearful/Inhibited

## Antisocial Personality Disorder
Pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others, beginning in childhood and lasting through adulthood.

Diagnostic Criteria:
1. Three or more of the following:
	* Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviour
	* Deceitfulness
	* Impulsivity/failure to plan ahead
	* Irritability/aggresiveness
	* Reckless disregard for own or others' safety
	* Irresponsibility
	* Lack of remorse
2. The individual must be at least 18 years of age
3. Evidence of conduct disorder in childhood
	* Persistent pattern of behaviour involving aggression to people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness, theft, etc.
4. Not exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder

With other disorders, people report their behaviours causing individual distress and problems. However, people with antisocial personality disorder attribute their success to this pattern of behaviour and so they do not report it as such. We have to take account of the greater good of the community (distress caused to people in contact with someone with this disorder).

## Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
**Obsession**:A pattern of unwanted, inappropriate, and persistent thoughts  
**Compulsion**: Repetitive, ritualistic behaviours

Both are really related to each other. Compulsions are a mechanism for controlling their obsession. For example, people with an obsession of being clean, develop a compulsion to do lots of cleaning.

Common obsessions and the common compulsions for it:
* Contamination - Cleaning
* Doubting - Checking
* Arranging things in a specific pattern - Repeating actions
* Aggressive thoughts
