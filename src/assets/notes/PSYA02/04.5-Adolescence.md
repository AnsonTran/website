# Adolescence
Period of development between childhood and adulthood, about age 12-25
* Begins at puberty (different based on age, gender, etc.)
* Ends at brain maturity - increase and refinement of connections in the
  prefrontal cortex
Biological definition of adolescence is different from age 18, usually
associated with right to vote, drive, drink, etc.

Major psychological changes also occur affecting:
* Self-esteem
* Identity
* Sexuality
* Morality

**Executive Behaviours**: Prefrontal cortex is responsible for decision
making, goal-driven behaviour, inhibition

**Positivity bias(self-enhancement)** -Kids often describe themselves positively
* 4-year olds almost always over-enhance
* 6-year olds do so at a lesser degree
* Less pronounced for peers than for self

**Protective Optimism**-Believe positive traits are unchangeable, and
negative traits have the potential to change easily -
*If they are nice, they will be nice forever*

Both bias and optimism decline quickly at school age, due to
* Evaluation compared to other kids their age (objective evaluation)
* Cognitive skills increase, as we learn more about how the world works
* Begin to view the world from not just their own perspectives, and learn
  that other people may not see them the way they see themselves

Adolescents slowly gain self esteem through development, and adults slowly
lose self esteem as they age. Highly correlated with medical decline.

Relatively speaking, self-esteem is relatively consistent across the lifespan.
* Maintain rank-order stability
* Genetics plays a big factor, but not all

## Identity Formation
Finding out what oneself is. How one defines oneself for the rest of one's life.

**Erik Erikson**: German-American developmental scientist, developed a theory
of *conflicts* and *resolutions*.
* Believed that adolescents chief task was to figure out who they were
* *Abstract thinking*
* *Self-socialization* - Choosing friends and social groups
* *Personal fable* - "No one can possibly understand me"

Challenges that the adolescent experiences:
* Identity confusion - Not knowing who they are
* Identity foreclosure - Choose an identity too early (picking careers)
* Negative identity - Opposition to others/social norms

Adults experience widespread changes to their physiology for the remainder
of their lives including
* Changes in sensory systems (vision, audition, etc.)
* Neuron (brain cell death)
	* Causes changes in memory storage and retrieval at different rates
		* Episodic memory - remember an event that happened in time
		* Semantic memory - remember specific information (spit facts)
	* Slowing of cognitive processes
However, adults can make up for this with their vast experience, and can employ
better cognitive strategies

Older adults tend to remember *positive* stimuli better than negative stimuli.
Tends to be the most positive, happiest, satisfying periods of life

# Intelligence
The ability to
* learn or understand, or to deal with new or challenging situations
* apply knowledge to manipulate one's environment
* think abstractly as measured by some objective criteria

Intelligence predicts a lot of things:
* Academic success
* Economic success
* Occupational success
* Predicts success on standardized tests, often used as gatekeepers
* Effects of intelligence are *self-perpetuating* (similar to rich get richer,
  but intelligence)

Intelligence comes from:
* Gentics
	* More similar between identical twins than fraternal twins
	* Adopted children are more similar to biological parents
