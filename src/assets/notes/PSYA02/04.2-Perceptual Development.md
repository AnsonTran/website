# Perceptual Development
Begins in utero, but experiences after birth are much *richer*.

**Sensation**: Detection of physical signals in environment

**Perception**: Organization, interpretation of information to understanding of objects, individuals, events
* Infants spend more time looking at interesting, stimulating, or familiar objects and events, called **preferential looking**.
* Most prefer patterned images over gray ones (more interesting)
* More time looking at gray ones vs. patterned ones indicates low **visual acuity** (eyes arent developing well)

Infant acuity about 20/120 and catches up quickly, adult-like at 6 months
