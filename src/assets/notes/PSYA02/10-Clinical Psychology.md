# Clinical Psychology
**Mental disorder**: persistent disturbance or dysfunction in behaviour, thoughts, or emotions that causes significant distress or impairment.

**Medical model**: abnormal, distressing psychological experiences are classified as illnesses that have biological causes.

**Biopsychosocial model**: abnormal, distressing psychological experiences are classified as illnesses that have biological, psychological, and social causes.

**Psychopathology**: the scientific study of mental disorders

**Overpathologizing**: attributing diverse or atypical behaviours or thoughts to psychological illness, particularly when diagnostic criteria are not met

The **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders**(DSM-5)
* Published by American Psychiatric Association
* Used predominantly in North America
* ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases) used elsewhere
* Uses biopsychosocial model
* Only to be used by clinicians
* Divides mental disorders into 22 categories, including:
	* Anxiety disorders
	* Depressive disorders
	* Bipolar (and related) disorders
	* Personality disorders
	* Obsessive-compulsive disorders
* Includes information about each disorder that it classifies
	* Diagnostic criteria
	* Onset
	* Prognosis
	* Risk factors/etiology
	* Comorbidites
* Most DSM disorders have three diagnostic criteria in common
	1. Causes significant distress/affects functioning
	2. Cannot be attributed to substance use or other medical condition
	3. Cannot be better described by another DSM diagnosis
* Criticisms of the DSM:
	* Causes overpathologizing, used to label without making sure that the person meets all diagnostic criteria
	* Binary, labels people as having or not having a disorder. Does not allow for a spectrum of disorders. Lumps people together into one big order, when there is a diversity in people with the disorder.

**Diagnostic Criteria**: a set of symptoms, behaviours, or characteristics that must be present in order to diagnose an individual with a disorder
* For physiological disorders, diagnostic critera can be simple. For example, with coronavirus, the diagnostic criteria is that the virus is present in the body.
* For mental disorders, it is not a black-and-white diagnostic test. Rely on a set of criteria evaluated with a number of different instruments.
	* Questionnaires
	* Interviews
	* Patient history

**Onset**: The chronological age or situational period when the symptoms of a disorder first appear in an individual (when does it usually start?)

**Prognosis**: The likely course (trajectory, development) of a disorder. What will happen next? When will the disorder go into remission?

**Risk Factors**: Set of biological, psychological, and social characteristics that increase the likelihood of having the disorder

**Etiology**: Biological, psychological, and/or social causes of a disorder. What causes the disorder? What makes one individual more likely to have the disorder than another individual?

**Comorbidities**: Other psychological or physical disorders that frequently co-occur with the disorder in question. What other disorders often appear with this one?
