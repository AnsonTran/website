# Emotion
## Emotional Intelligence
The ability to reason about emotions and to use emotions to enhance reasoning. Emotional intelligence is not tested by traditional IQ tests.

Individuals with **high** emotional intelligence show less brain activation when solving emotional problems.

**Emotion**: *positive* or *negative* response to stimulus(internal thought or external environmental events)
* Physiological: racing heart, tense muscles
* Cognitive: subjective conscious experience
* Behavioral: characteristic overt expressions, facial expressions, posture

* Defined by valence(positive or negative) and psychological arousal (severity)

Emotions developed as a way for us to survive(happiness to increase social cohesion, fear to keep out of danger, anger to overcome obstacles, etc.)

## Theories of Emotion
Theories of emotion disagree on what cause emotion
* Preception of stimulus
* Physiological state
* Cognitive interpretation of stimulus

**Common Sense View**
stimulus > emotion > arousal  
see a bear > causes fear > causes increased heartrate

**James-Lange Theory**
stimulus > arousal > emotion  
see a bear > causes increases heartrate > causes experience of fear

**Cannon-Bard Theory**
stimulus > emotion & arousal  
see a bear > causes increased heartrate AND experience of fear separately

**Schachter-Singer Two-Factory Theory**
stimulus > arousal > cognition > emotion  
stimulus causes physiological state, brain interprets that state emotionally,

## Neuroscience View
Related neural structures to emotion:
* Amygdala - primitive, quickly processes biologically relevant information
* Prefrontal cortex - advanced, slowly processes information rationally

Friend tries to scare you, thalamus processes the sound, movement, etc. and sends to the amygdala and prefrontal cortex

Amygdala immediately triggers survival based fear response  

Prefrontal cortex makes you calm down, laugh.

## Emotional Regulation
Emotional regulation is a somewhat learned strategy. Adults are good at regulating emotions, younger children are not. There are several factors:
* Internal feeling state (how we feel)
* Emotion-related cognitions
* Emotion-related physiological processes
* Emotion-related behavior

Much is related to **temperament**
* Levels of emotionality(positive/negative)
* Ability to self-regulate emotion
* Predominantly biologically based

Infant strategies (begins to appear after 6 months):
* **Gaze aversion**
* **Self-soothing**

Strategies:
* **Distraction** by thinking/doing something else from experiences (more often negative stimuli)
* **Suppression** of negative thoughts
* **Affect Labelling**, naming emotional experiences
* **Re-appraisal**, think of emotion-inducing stimulus in a different way

## Emotional Expression
Observable **signs** of an emotional state (not symbols, symbols have an arbitrary relationship with the thing that it represents). People can read your emotional state and figure out whether you're angry or sad, etc.
* Facial expression
* Tone of voice
* Body language
* Rhythm of gait (walk fast when angry, walk slow when sad)

## Charles Darwin's Universality Hypothesis
Proposed that facial expressions are **evolved** and therefore **universal** in the human population.

He believed facial gestures evolved in order to aid in survival.

### Support for Universality Hypothesis
* People with visual impairments, have never seen a smiling face, also smile
* 2-day old infants produce disgusted faces similar to adults
* Isolated cultures evaluate Westerners' facial expressions the same way that other Westerners do

### Criticisms for Universality Hypothesis
Relationships between different emotions are different across cultures
* North American culture, think of happiness and joy, sadness and despair as opposite emotions
* In other cultures, happiness and sadness may be more closely related to each other

There are cultures where smiling may mean something different (Thailand)

## Facial Feedback Hypothesis
Based on common sense, most people agree that emotional state comes first before facial expressions.

Hypothesis argues that facial expressions can cause/change an individual's emotional experience. Does not argue that it causes all changes in emotional state, but there can be a feedback loop.

By holding pen between their teeth, it forces them to smile and puts them in a more positive emotional state.

## Deceptive Expression
There are many reasons we may want to hide our emotions

**Intensification**  
Making an expression seem more intensified than how you're actually feeling
1. You get socks for Christmas, but it's not the most exciting gift
2. You feel somewhat grateful, but not too excited
3. You intensify your feeling of gratefulness

**De-intensification**  
Downplay an emotional state
1. You're on a date with someone you're very excited about
2. You don't want them to think you're "totally nuts"
3. Pull back. You de-intensify your excitedness

**Masking**  
Changing an emotional expression into another
1. You're really disappointed, when someone buys you a shirt with a bad color
2. Mask that disappointment, change it to gratitude

**Neutralizing**  
Turning off an emotional expression
1. Your dog dies
2. You're at work, and want to stay professional
3. You turn off the feeling of sadness

## Detecting a Fake Expression
As well, we can determine whether facial expressions are real or not

**Morphology**
* Certain facial muscles are resistant to conscious change (reliable muscles)
* Its much harder to control your eyes than it is to control your mouth. You can tell whether an expression is real is through these reliable muscles.

**Symmetry**
* In genuine expressions, we see smmetrical facial gestures
* Uneven/unbalanced facial gestures are more likely to be insecure.

**Duration**  
* Sincere expressions last between 0.5s and 5s
* A short facial expression is a queue that the expression is insecure.

**Temporal Patterning**  
* Microexpressions appear first and are sincere
* You see things like the eyes changing, before the smile starts to appear. Sincere gestures appear and disappear gradually rather than suddenly.
