# Biological Treatment
Consists broadly of:
* Medications including:
	* Antipsychotic
	* Anti-anxiety
	* Antidepressants
	* Herbal/natural products
* Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)
	* Sends an electrical pulse through the brain, is said to 'reset' some neurons in the brain
	* Bad reputation in media
* Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)
	* Uses magnets to manipulate certain areas of the brain
	* Can use TMS to disable certain parts of the brain
	* Also used in research when trying to figure out what a certain part of the brain does.
	* Non-invasive, safe
* Psychosurgery
  * Destruction or repair of specific brain areas. Used quite rarely, and only in the most severe of cases

## Anti-Psychotic Medication
Use of medication for psychological illness began with an accident. Schizophrenia patients were given **thorazine**, a drug that **blocks dopamine receptors**. Patients became euphoric and calm, and less-agitated.

Introduction of these anti-psychotic medications changed the wya that schizophrenia is treated.

Newer anti-psychotics regulate **both** dopamine and seratonin and may be more effective.

Since the discovery of anti-psychotics, other mental illnesses have come to be treated with medication:
* Anti-anxiety medications (benzodiazepines)
	* Works on neurotransmitters, specifically GABA
	* GABA decreases neuroactivity in the brain
	* Drug increases GABA in the brain and inhibits anxious behaviours
	* Works well in the short term, but bad long-term effects
		* Drug tolerance - Need higher and higher doses
		* Withdrawal symptoms
		* Drowsiness
		* Poor coordination
	* Not meant to be taken on a regular basis

## Anti-Depressant Medication
Also discovered accidentally. Doctors were prescribing **Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors** to treat tuberculosis in the 1950s.
* Found to prevent break-down of serotonin and dopamine, which elevated patient's moods
* However, it caused intolerable side effects (dizziness, loss of sexual interest)

Most anti-depressant medications today are **reuptake inhibitors**.
* Prevents neurotransmitters from being taken back up
* Increases concentration of neurotransmitters in the synaptic space
* Can work on many neurotransmitters or just one
	* Seratonin only (SSRIs; e.g. Cipralex)
	* Seratonin and norepinephine (Tricyclic antidepressants; e.g. Effexor)

Antidepressants are quite effective for treating depression. It is important to distinguish between bipolar and depression, as bipolar has its own set of medications. There are some wide-ranging side effects to antidepressants:
* Difficulting concentrating
* Sexual side effects
* Weight gains
* Emotional "numbness" (no high mood as well)
* Withdrawal symptoms (e.g. brain 'zaps')

## Natural and Alternative Solutions
Not about natural supplements, or herbs, but natural treatments for psychotherapy, particularly depression and anxiety, such as:
* Aerobic exercise
* Eating healthy foods
* Lots of the stuff that helps with stress can also help with depression
