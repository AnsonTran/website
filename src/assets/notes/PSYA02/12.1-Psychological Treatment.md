# Psychological Treatment
There are many types of psychological treatment, or psychotherapy. Techniques in psychotherapy are referred to as **orientations**.

## Psychodynamic Therapy
In a psychoanalytic session, we would expect to discuss:
* Childhood events
* Dreams

This therapy is centered on the belief that psychological problems come from ineffectively repressing aggressive or sexual urges in childhood. Psychoanalysis attempts to give the patient **insight** into these conflicts.

Has its roots in Freud's methods of *psychoanalysis*

Freud fixation + adult personality:

Disruptions in certain stages led to specific types of behaviours in adulthood.

**Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)** has replaced some of Freud's methods with a focus on:
* Grief (loss of a relationship)
* Role disputes (conflicts within a relationship)
* Role transitions (changes in life status, jobs, etc.)
* Interpersonal deficits (lack of skills to start/maintain relationships)

## Humanistic/Existential Therapies
Humanistic psychologists emphasize:
* The importance of striving for personal improvement
* Free will
* The positive aspects of the human experience

**Person-centered Therapy** assumes individuals have a tendency towards growth; centres on acceptance and genuine reactions from therapist
* Unconditional positive regard, even if they themself don't agree with them
* Empathy
* Congruence (words, body language, etc.)
* Therapist acts as a mirror that reflects the individuals sentiments in positive ways

## Behavioral/Cognitive Therapy
Most common type of psychotherapy in Canada, probably because of the wealth of evidence suggesting their efficacy.

Behavioral/cognitive therapy relies on **behaviorism**- study of observable, measurable variables

Focuses on changing **behavior**(action) or **cognition**(thoughts) to combat mental illness.

Behavioral therapy centers around **conditioning**:
* Operant Conditioning
	* Rewards for positive behavior; punishments for negative behavior
	* One method is token economy: rewarding positive behavior with vouchers
* Classical Conditioning
	* The most common way CC is used is in Exposure therapy
		* Harmless, repeated exposure to a stimulus believed to be threatening
		* Results in reduction in threat response

While behavioral therapy worlds to change actions, cognitive therapy works to change unhealthy thought patterns leading to mental illness. Cognitive therapists focus on restructuring irrational thought process
* A therapeutic approach that teaches clients to question the automatic beliefs, assumptions, and predictions that lead to negative emotions
	* I will never make friends - What friends have you had in the past? Where? When?
	* I will never be able to succeed in school - What successes have you had in the past? Where? When?
* Replaces irrational, negative thoughts with rational, positive ones.

Many therapists combine behavioral and cognitive orientations into one technique: **cognitive-behavioral therapy** (CBT). Most common psychological treatment for depression and anxiety. CBT is:
* Problem focused
* Action oriented - individual often assigned homework to combat thoughts
* Transparent (unlike psychoanalysis) - therapist explains the whole process to the patient, some of the theory behind it

CBT uses the ABC model:
* Activating Event
	* Actual event - losing a cat
	* Client's immediate interpretation of event - will never have a pet like it
* Beliefs
	* Evaluation
	* Rational/Irrational belief
* Consequences
	* Emotions
	* Behaviors
	* Other thoughts

CBT aims to change irrational beliefs on the right to rational beliefs on the left. Instead of wallowing in depression, become hopeful for the future.
