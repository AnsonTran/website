# Personality Theories
Psychologists also want to describe and explain personality

## Trait approach
1. Individuals rate themselves on hundreds of traits
2. Highly correlated traits are combined into factors (outgoing -> extrovertedness)
3. No correlation between traits are separate factors

Researches grouped them into five factors that have very little correlation **OCEAN**
1. Openness
    * High: Creative, artisitic, curious, imaginative, nonconforming
    * Low:  Conventional, down-to-earth
2. Conscientiousness
    * High: Ambitious, organized, realiable
    * Low:  Unreliable, lazy, casual, spontaneous
3. Extraversion
    * High: Talkative, optimistic, social, affectionate
    * Low:  Reserved, comfortable with being alone, introverted
4. Agreeableness
    * High: Good-natured, trusting, supportive
    * Low:  Rude, uncooperative, irritable, hostile, competitive
5. Neuroticism
    * High: Worried, insecure, anxiety-prone
    * Low:  Tranquil, secure, emotionally stable

Neuroticism is reverse-coded, i.e. its better to score lower than higher

Personality traits are relatively stable and stability increases across the lifetime
* People age 11 compared to themself at age 6 are highly correlated
* People age 39 compared to themself at age 30 are even more highly correlate

**Rank-order**: "If in a sample of 100 people, you ranked highest in openness, it is likely that you will be among the highest in openness among the general population as well" 

**Mean-level Changes**: As a group of people in a certain age group i.e. 20-30, everyone's traits change similarly, so rank-order doesnt change

**Intraindividual Change**: Significant changes in a person's personality from one time to the next  
* Occurs after life-changing experiences, including trauma.  
* Changes the person's rank-order in the population.

**Personality States**: Although personality traits are stable and remain consistent, personality states may alter the way we express them:  
* Location
* Associations
* Activities
* Mood

## Biological Approach
Traits takes a very biological approach to describing personalities. Genetics is the largest **single** factor

Trait Dimension   | Heritability
------------------|----------------
Openness          | 0.45
Conscientiousness | 0.38
Extraversion      | 0.49
Agreeableness     | 0.35
Neuroticism       | 0.41

**Herability Factor**: A range [0,1] that indicates how much of a factor genetics influences a trait. 0 means no influence, 1 means completely responsible for the trait

**Temperament**: Infant's characteristic activity level, mood, attention span, and distractability.
* Infant's temperament is predictive of adult personalities

**WEIRD**: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic
* Most research on Big Five are conducted in WEIRD cultures
* **Prevalence** of personality traits *does* vary from culture to culture
* Culture may play a role in determinating an individual's personality

## Behaviourist Approach
The next four approaches to describing personality focus on experiences

**Behaviourism**: Produce, reinforce, and repeat a behaviour
* Training a dog, or lab rats to do something when blowing a whistle
* Behaviourists believe that the same principle applies to human personality
    1. A human produces a behaviour (smiling at a peer)
    2. Behaviour is reinforced - something good happens as a result (the peer becomes friendly)
    3. Behaviour is repeated (person smiles more often)

## Social-Cognitive Approach
In this approach, personality is how we deal with situations encountered in daily life
* How we **construct** situations in our own minds
* How we **respond** to those situations
Distinct from trait approach, in which people behave the same way across mosts situations

**Person-Situation Controversy**: Personality is defined more by the situation we're in instead of traits
* Introverted people do not spend much more time alone than extroverted people do

**Situation-Dependent**:
* Would you speed while driving?
* Would you rob a bank?
Both are likely governed by agreeableness, but an agreeable person is more likely to speed than to rob a bank

**Personal Constructs**: The way in which we organize people in our lives
* Resonsible
* Outgoing
* Lazy

**Outcome Expectancies**: How we expect a behaviour to bring us **closer** or **further** from our goals
* Be more confident -> Get a job
* Responsible -> Finish homework on time
