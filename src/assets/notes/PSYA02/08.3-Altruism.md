# Altruism
Altruism is behaviour that benefits another without benefitting oneself. In any case that may seem like altruism, there can be arguments that argue against it being a case of altruism.

If someone gives a dollar to a homeless person, one can argue that the person giving receives societal benefits (oh wow look at me, im such a nice person).

In non-human animals, we see altruism in:
* **Kinship Selection** - taking care of related kin, to increase likelihood of their genetic material being passed on
* **Reciprocation** - protecting another, with expectation that the favour will be returned

We would not call this true altruism however, because there is some kind of way of benefitting them.
