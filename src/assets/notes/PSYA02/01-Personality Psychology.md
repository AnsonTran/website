# Personality Psychology
## Personality
Personality is an individual's characteristic of:
* Behaviour
* Thought
* Feeling

Personalities are relatively stable throughout our lifetimes. We can somewhat predict what someone will be like when they're old based on what their personality is now.

Even though the way we act towards a group of friends may be different from how we act in a professional setting, there are a lot of similarities between them.

We study personalities using two different approaches:
* Idiographic approach - individual differences (each person)
* Nomothetic approach - common trends in the population

We study two components of personalities:
* Describing personality:
    * Characteristics of a person
* Explaining personality:
    * Why doesnt everyone have the same personality?
    * Not just 'why im introverted', but 'what causes me to be introverted'
    * Personality theories

## Measuring personality
* Observe an individual's personality
    * put people in a certain situation and see how they behave
    * observe people in their day-to-day life

Naturalistic observation - Observe people in their day-to-day life
Demand characteristics - People watching alters their behaviour

## Personality Inventories (tests/scales)
* People self-report their behaviour
* People know themselves better and can share their thoughts and feelings, usually hidden
* Personality tests should be administered by people who are trained
* The way the tests are administered, the interpretation, can affect the results
* Social Desirability Bias - Want to answer in a way that is socially acceptable

Types of questions:
* Yes/no questions
* Scalar questions 1-10

## [Bad Personality Tests](http://www.gotoquiz.com/personality_quiz_1)
* Question options are not exhaustive (may not find an answer that applies to them)
* Barnem Effect - Descriptions are so vague that everyone can see themselves in that situation
* Don't know what the tests are trying to measure

## Validity
* High validity - measure the psychological construct they are designed to measure
* Compare with other tests that are old and validated
* Look at whether people actually portray what results we give them
* MMPI is widely reliable, clinically valid personality test - contains lots of true/false/cant answer questions

## Reliability
* Take the same multiple choice many times, but get different answer
    * Consistency of results
* Blood tests are 100\% reliable
* Psychological tests are never 100\% reliable, because personalities change from state to state

## MMPI Test
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory(MMPI) is a widely reliable, clinically valid personality test
* Contains true/false/null questions, that force you into one category or another
* A lot of questions cause fatigue, tires you out so you dont want to fake ur answers
* Test administrators bias is less of a problem with true/false responses
* Test takers may not know everything about themselves
* Test takes can be biased, and report socially desirable traits

## Validity scales
Validity scales are not meant to measure personality, but measure their test-taking

**F-scale** - high rates of "true" responses can indicate severe psychopathology or over-reporting
* "Evil spirits possess me at times"
* "There is something wrong with my mind"
* "I have gotten many physical beatings"

**Lie-scale** - high rates of "false" responses may indicate lying
* "I dont always tell the truth"
* "Sometimes I feel like swearing"
* "Once in a while I think about things that are too bad to talk about"

**?-scale** - high rates of "idk" may indicate an invalid test
