## Split Brain
A procedure severing a large band of axons that connect the two hemispheres of the brain, known as **corpus callosum**. This procedure was done to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures associated with epilepsy.

The procedure reduced seizures, but the two hemispheres of the brain are unable to share information across the cortex, and several regions associated with perception are isolated from parts of the brain involved in language.

> Shown the word on the right field of view, the left hemisphere of the brain can verbally process the word.
> However shown the word on the left field of view, the right hemisphere can draw the word, but can't say what they saw.

## The Mirror/Rouge Test of Self-Awareness
The mirror test tries to study self-awareness in animals. The researcher hung mirrors in the cages of animals while they were elsewhere. They noted that animals react in three stages:
1. The animals react as though a new member of their species was there
2. The animals ignore the reflection because it has no information value
3. Some animals re-engage and start "using the mirror"

> Dogs are scent-focused animals, so they consistently reach the second stage, but not the third

The method was formalized as the Mirror Test (animals) or Rouge Test (humans) of self-awareness:
1. Expose an animal to a mirror and let them reach whatever stage they reach
2. Sometime when you have to anesthetize them anyway (dental), place odorless marks on one eye ridge and the other ear lobe
3. Let the animal recover from surgery
4. Show them their reflection, including the marks
5. If the animal touches the marks more often than the non-marked parts, it suggests they are self-aware.

> Human children often do not pass the mirror test until they are older than 1.5-2 years old

### Povinelli's Alternate Explanation
Chimpanzees have a very strong awareness of their bodies, since they need to climb trees and swing on branches. Povinelli believes that the chimpanzee looks at the reflection akin to a video game character. When touching the marked parts, the chimpanzee is controlling the character, not necessarily "themself".

## Hypnosis
### Dissociation Theories of Hypnosis
When performed as entertainment, stage hypnosis gives one the impression that people have transferred all decision making to the hypnotist.

Its hard to study the effects of hypnosis, since studying whether a person would do something unethical under hypnosis would itself be unethical.

### Socio-Cognitive Theory
Suggests that hyponotized people are largely playing along. They have an opportunity to break the previous command of the hypnotist, but the hypnotist will usually put them to sleep if they push them too far.

### Clinical Hypnosis
Hypnotic induction almost always begins with progressive relaxation. The resulting state of deep relaxation often makes the client open to suggestion and capable of experiencing rich imagery.

A therapist can use this context to produce strong assocations, or to walk through positive mental experiences, that can have an effect after the session.
