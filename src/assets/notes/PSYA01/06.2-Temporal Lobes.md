# Temporal Lobes
Assist with forming memories and processing sound input from the auditory nerves. This region consists of:
* [[14.2-Language Regions#Wernicke's Area|Wernicke's area]] - Region important for processing language. 
* Olfactory cortex - Responsible for sense of smell. The only sense that does not go through the [[05.2-Coordinators#Thalamus|thalamus]], but goes straight to the temporal lobes

Lesions (focused areas where cells have died) in this region can cause:
* Memory loss
* [[13-Memory#Forgetting|Anterograde amnesia]]

## Primary Auditory Cortex
The primary auditory cortex is mostly hidden from view, lying on the inside of the upper temporal lobe. Damage to the primary auditory cortex causes an inability to perceive sound, without damage to the ear or the cochlear nerve. The information is being coded and received, but can't be used effectively.

## Auditory Association Cortex
The auditory association cortex is located on the lateral surface of the upper temporal lobe.

Although damage to left or right sides of the brain can lead to different deficits, it varies from person to person. People who are left-handed often share language and music functions between both sides of the association cortex.

### Left Auditory Association Cortex
Damage to the left side of the assocation leads to severe language deficits. Patients lose the ability to comprehend or produce meaningful speech.

### Right Auditory Association Cortex
Damage to the right side of the association cortex affects ability to properly perceive non-speech sounds, like rhythm in music
