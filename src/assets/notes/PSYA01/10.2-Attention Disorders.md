# Attention Disorders
When regions of the brain that facilitate attention are damaged or work differently from normal, the experience of consciousness is also affected. Deficits in attention influence our ability to perceive and respond to information, and influence perceptions of reality itself.

## Visual Neglect
Visual neglect is an attention disorder that results from legions on the right (inferior) parietal lobe of the cortex. This causes patients to lose awareness of visual stimuli on the left. Individuals affected by this may shave or apply makeup to half their face, eat food from half their plate, etc. Most patients are unaware that anything is wrong.

The late processing of the dorsal visual system travels to the inferior parietal lobe, which helps identify the location of visual stimuli. Individuals with visual neglect are still able to report some details of color and form of the visually neglected stiuli. The "what" visual system is still evaluating several components of the entire visual message, despite the fact that participants are unaware of them.

### Marshall and Halligan (1988)
For patients with visual neglect, information that is not brought to conscious awareness can still impact their behaviour. In this study, participants were shown two nearly identical houses:

Participants consistently chose the image that was not on fire, but could not articulate the reason why.

## Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
ADHD is one of the most commonly diagnosed psychological problems in childhood, and disrupts normal development. The primary characteristics of ADHD can be expressed at different levels on a spectrum.
1. Inattention
2. Impulsivity
3. Hyperactivity

Causes for ADHD are unclear, but suggest that genetics influence the expression of the disorder. Symptions are similar to those produced by damage to the prefrontal cortex.

ADHD can be managed by prescription medication such as Ritalin and Adderall, which help to improve concentration and hyperactivity. Behavioural treatment can also help, by rewarding desired behavior and ignoring undersirable actions.
