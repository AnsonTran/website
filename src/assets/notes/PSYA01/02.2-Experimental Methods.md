# Experimental Methods
Experimental research aims to explain cause-and-effect relationships and correlations that we find in descriptive methods. 

## Hypothesis
A prediction about the outcome of an event because of something that we are doing. A good hypothesis should be:
* Consistent with prior observations or an existing theory
* As simple as possible. More than two variables complicates the relationship
* Specific about who we are measuring, what changes will be made during the experiment, and what we predict the changes will do to the outcome
* Testable, stating what will be measured and used as a point of comparison
* Falsifiable, so that we can compare competing theories

> People that play violent video games will hit, kick, bite, or push others more frequently than people who do not play violent video games.

## Independent Variable
The variable that the experimenter will manipulate. It should contain at least two levels:
* Experimental group - Plays violent video games
* Control group - Only plays non-violent video games

> The independent variable here is the type of video games people play

## Dependent Variables
The outcome variable that the experimenter counts or measures.

> The dependent variable in this case would be the level of aggressive behavior in participants

## Extraneous Variables
Variables that are not the focus of the study, but can influence the outcome of research if not controlled. 

> Gender should be spread evenly across violent and non-violent gaming conditions

## Sample Selection
Selecting participants for the experimental and control groups. Groups must be unbiased, and representative of the bigger population.
* Simple random sample - Every individual has an equal chance of participating. If large enough, it should approximate the larger population
* Stratified random sample - Divides the population into subgroups, then randomly takes samples in proportion to the population of interest
* Non-random sample - Not all individuals are equally likely to participate, usually because we are studying a pre-existing condition such as a concussion.

## Placebo Effect
Suppose we are studying the effects of a new drug. The expectation of a new drug can affect the outcomes of the study in a **placebo effect**. So, researchers may create a *placebo* group with dummy treatments to control for our expectations.

## Internal Validity
*Was the experiment done right?* The degree to which results may be attributable to the independent variable rather than some other effect of our study.

If controlled correctly, we should be able to repeat the experiment and reach the same conclusion.

## External Validity
*Do the results apply in the real world?* The degree to which a result can be applied beyond the scope of the experiment.

We can be more confident in the external validity if the same experiment can be replicated in different settings, populations, and contexts.

## Descriptive Statistics
Using statistics to explain and describe the data, using quantitative values. Includes information such as:
* Mean - The average value. It can be significantly affected by outliers in the data. 
* Median - The middle value. Less prone to influence by outliers.
* Mode - The most frequencly occuring value. Useful when dealing with categories that cannot be averaged.
* Frequency of certain demographics (51% of participants were male)

> Mean - $73444
> Median - $54000

Another factor we want to measure is the variability between two data sets.
* Range - The difference between the largest value and the lowest value.
* Standard Deviation - A more robust measurement of variability

Squared deviations are the difference between the score and mean. It is squared to account for negative values.
$$squared\ deviation=(score-mean)^2$$

Variance is the average of the squared deviations.
$$variance=\frac{\sum(score-mean)^2}{n}$$

Standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
$$standard\ deviation=\sqrt{variance}$$

> Class A range - (100-60)=40
> Class B range - (82-78)=4

> Class A variance - 200
> Class B variance - 2

## Inferential Statistics
Determining whether there are real differents between the independent variable condition, to make inferences about the causal relationship between the IV and DV. 

An event is **statistically significant** and unlikely to happen due to chance alone, if the probability (*p*) of the event is less than 5% ($p<0.05$)
