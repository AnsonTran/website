# Problem Solving
Problems start with an initial problem state, where there is an end goal in mind. To achieve the solution, we need to select appropriate strategies.

## Approach to a Problem
An important aspect of problem solving is how we approach the problem. Based on the two problems below, studies show that:
* Participants who practice on Problem A questions before performing Problem B questions, transferred the strategy they first practiced. They were less likely to apply new strategies.
* Participants who did not have exposure and practice with the A set, were less likely to routinely apply a solution

The first group of participants approached a new problem with a fixed solution, and persisted with their prior expectation. Their **mental set**, expectation of how to solve a problem, was influenced by their prior interaction. This created a *set effect* or *fixation*, limiting their application of new solutions.

> **Problem A**: Meausre out 100 ounces into the target cup

> **Problem B**: Measure out 20 ounces into the target cup

## Functional Fixedness
We are susceptible to developing **functional fixedness**, viewing an object as only having one function, and neglecting to see other possible uses.

> Participants frustratingly create possible solutions but were rarely successful. A similar solution is pictured.

> Another condition presents the items outside of the box

> Participants are less likely to become fixated on the function of the box as a holder for tacks. They saw the utility of co-opting the box as a shelf for their candle.

## Strategy
Researchers find that humans employ a variety of **algorithms**, a precise set of rules applied in order solve a problem. Individual differences and environment will determine which algorithm we apply.

*Trial and error* is commonly used when there are a limited number of available options. Participants tend to use a sequential step of processes to try to solve the problem. Our goal is to continue to move in the *right direction*, anywhere that is closer to the goal-state, or the solution.

## Heuristics
Instead of trying random options, we develop a consistent **heuristic** to apply. These help create shortcuts to the lengthy judgement and decision-making processes.

### Means-End Heuristic
The problem solver envisions the desired goal-state and takes whatever measures necessary to attain that goal.
* Attempted solutions moving closer to the goal state, make solvers happy
* A necessary move that appears to drift away from the solution will make the solver unhappy.

### Representative Heuristic
Involves mentally comparing something to our stored *prototype* of an event, object, or person.

The representative heuristic helps us intuitively solve problems quickly, but can lead to errors in problem solving. We risk ignoring the base-rate information, or probability.

Suppose we are solving the following problem:

> Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations. She is most likely:
> 1. A bank teller
> 2. A bank teller and feminist

The first option is a superset of the second option, and hence is always more probable. However, based on the description, people are likely to pick the second option. We've ignored the probability information when making our decision.

Nurses need to be aware of representative heuristics when making diagnoses. A study has nurses making a diagnoses based on two descriptions of the patient:

> A 60-year-old male patient is admitted in an emergency ward with the following symptoms: pain radiating to left arm, skin eruption, accelerated pulse rate, pressure on the chest, pain while passing urine, strong leg pain, shortness of breath, sore throat, and a low level of oxygen in the blood.

> A 60-year-old male patient **who was just fired from his job**Â is admitted in an emergency ward with the following symptoms..

Nurses in the first condition identified the patient as suffering from a heart attack. However, in the second condition, they more likely attributed the pain to a stress reaction.

### Availability Heuristic
Heuristics come into effect when assessing the frequency, or likelihood of an occurence. We make judgements based on how easily instances of the same or related events are retrieved from our memory, or how available those memories are.

We believe that plane crashes are more likely than they actually are, because they are always reported on the news. We are always able to bring up instances of plane crashes from our memory.

## Creativity
Creativity doesn't require complete novelty, and sometimes relies on reusing old material and making new connections with it.

### Preparation
Gathering knowledge and proficiency with a topic. Expertise allows us to focus on important aspects of a task and not become inundated with irrelevant details.

In a task of memorizing chess pieces on a board, both performed equally when pieces were arranged randomly. However, if the pieces were arranged in a typical game formation, advanced players excelled.

They are able to group and chunk the pieces into known arrangements, decreasing the strain on their memories, and allowing them to recall more.

### Incubation
After preparation, some problems require incubation. This requires the idea to sit on the back burner while you consciously work on something unrelated. In this period, your memory is helping you process the information and making helpful connections.

Sleep helps to facilitate memory consolidation. In a study, participants complete a difficult word association task. (*sleeping*, *bean*, and *trash* are related through *bag*)
1. Awake incubation group stayed away for an eight-hour incubation period
2. Sleep incubation group slept for the eight-hour incubation period

The group that stayed awake performed better at easier items, while the group that slept performed better at more challenging problems.

### Illumination
A *Eureka* moment often comes as a surprise. This stage often follows a period of slight pre-awareness.

While it is good to give an idea time to grow, it is not good to *worry* about a problem.
* People with high levels of procrastination, but *constructive* thinking were found to have high rates of creativity
* People with high levels of procrastination, but *destructive* thinking were less creative

### Evaluation
After your inspired idea, we need to assess whether it is indeed, a creative and worthy solution.
