# Words and Objects
Words and related concepts are stored in whats known as a **mental lexicon**. This is organized by using:
* **Phonemes** - Smallest unit of sound information. The sound a letter represents.
* **Morphemes** - Smallest unit of language comprehension. The smallest, standalone portion of a word.

> For the word *prefix*, the sound *pa* is the phoneme, while *pre* is the morpheme.

The word is linked to other semantically similar information (the word's meaning), which helps:
* Put the word in context
* Retrieve relevant responses
* Detect errors in usage

Words are not stored by exact dictionary definitions. Instead, we store a general sense of information and define category membership by overlaps in similarity.

## Family Resemblance
When determining the species of a bird, we don't make an item-by-item comparison with every bird we've encountered. This would be time consuming and inefficient.

The family resemblance theory suggests we classify birds based on its similarity or dissimilarity to other members in the bird category.

Our pigeon category is based on a **prototype**, the most common, or typical form of the word. The closer a member is to the prototype, the easier it is to classify

> White pigeons, which is atypical of the pigeon category

## Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis
The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, also referred to as *linguistic relativity*, believes that the structural differences in language can alter our perception and understanding of reality.

Evidence shows that structural differences in language may be mimicked in thought patterns, influencing attention, memory, and reasoning:
* Native Russian speakers divide the blue color spectrum more precisely than native English speakers, since there are more words distinguishing between light and dark blue. Are more accurately able to distinguish between colors of blue.
* Native English speakers have two different distinctions between dark red and light red (pink).
* English speakers tend to speak of time in horizontal references (you put the past *behind*, you, look forward to the journey *ahead*). Tend to arrange events left to right.
* Mandarin speakers speak of time in vertical references (上个星期, 下个星期). Tend to arrange events from top to bottom.
* Guugu Yimithirr speakers use objective, compass-oriented directions to relay navigational information. More accurately remembered spatial information in spatial recognition tasks
* English speakers use subjective, self-referenced directions.

## Verbal Shadowing Task
Language is also important for completing reasoning and navigation tasks. The verbal shadowing task involves repeating a word back immediately after hearing it.

In the [[14-Language and Thought#Spatial Location Experiment|spatial location experiment]], a variant of the experiment requires participants to complete a verbal shadowing task at the same time. This causes **dual-task interference**, where the two tasks simultaneously compete for mental or physical resources. This causes adults to perform the task more like children and rats.

When sorting and matching blue squares, Russians lose their advantage when there was dual-task interference.

## Wisconsin Card Sorting Task
An example of directly impairing problem-solving abilities.
1. Participants match cards of different colors and grouped shapes by a designated rule.
2. The rule is not directly communicated to participants
3. Participants are given feedback when they make correct matches
4. The rule is learned through trial and error

> The card could be matched based on:
> 1. The triangle shape
> 2. The color of the card
> 3. The number of shapes

This is fairly easy for adults to complete, but may be difficult if:
1. Simultaneously completing a verbal shadowing task
2. Suffering from language aphasias, particularly Wernicke's aphasia
