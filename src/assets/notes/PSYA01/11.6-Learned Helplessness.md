# Learned Helplessness
When we experience aversive stimuli (pain), the aversive event activates the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. Unconditional responses (increased respiration and heart rate) provide energy and motivation to escape or avoid the situation. When our avoidance responses don't work, we stop trying to get away, and have acquired **learned helplessness**. 

## Seligman (1972)
Seligman found that dogs exposed to inescapable shock would quit trying to get away from the shock. In another experiment, dogs were placed in a shuttle box with a barrier between them and the opposite side.
* Escape group - Dogs could push a panel with their noses to turn off shock
* Learned helplessness - Dogs could push a panel, but does not stop the shock
* Control group - Dogs didn't receive a shock

In the second phase, all dogs could jump over the barrier to escape the shock
* Escape and control groups escaped 90-100% of the shocks
* Learned helplessness group escaped less than 30% of the shocks

When exposed to a situation where we can't escape something aversive, we won't try to escape an aversive situation later.
