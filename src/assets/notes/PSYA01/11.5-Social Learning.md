# Social Learning
Social learning (also observational or vicarious learning), is learning from other people. This type of learning was discovered by Albert Bandura, who explored further into the behavior realm, rather than strict behaviorism. It was revolutionary at the time, since social learning did not require reinforcement to occur. 

In **imitation**, there is a model or demonstrator, and an observer who imitates an observed action. The imitation of the behavior doesn't have to happen immediately. It can occur when there is an opportunity to use the new knowledge.

Bandura's theory specifies that observational learning occurs in four stages:
1. **Attentional** - We notice the model's behavior, and are more likely to imitate someone we like and respect.
2. **Retention** - We think about performing the model's action ourselves
3. **Production** - We actually perform the model's actions
4. **Motivational** - Imitated behavior produces the same reward as the model, so we are likely to repeat it in the future

## Bandura (1965)
Bandura wanted to study whether observing someone else perform a behavior would influence what they might do. In this study, there is an inflatable doll name Bobo. 
1. Agressive group - Children observed an adult aggressively interact with the Bobo doll
2. Gentle group - Children observed an adult gently playing with the doll
3. Control group - Children were not exposed to an adult interacting with the doll
4. After 10 minutes, the kid is taken to a room full of fun toys, which is taken away
5. The kid is left with the Bobo doll

Bandura observed that children in the first group were more aggressive and engaged in new aggressive behavior toward the doll than the other groups. Children who observed adults imitated what they saw the adults do.

## Hopper, Lambeth, Schapiro, Whiten (2008)
This study looks into whether a model would influence what chimpanzees and human children do.
1. Demonstrators of the same species move a door to the left or right
2. Once moved, the demonstrator reaches into the box to obtain a reward
3. Observer could move the door in either direction and still obtain a reward

The study found that all chimpanzees and children moved the door in the same direction as the demonstrator. In order to copy the behavior, the observer had to see the model's behavior and that they earned a reward for it.
