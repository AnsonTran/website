# Sleep Disorders
Sleep disorders can significantly affect an individual's quality of life. There are two categories of sleep disorders:
1. **Dyssomnias** - Problems with the quality of sleep
2. **Parasomnias** - Disturbances that occur during sleep

## Insomnia
A dyssomnia that is among the most commonly diagnosed sleep disorders. It is defined as the inability to fall asleep or to remain asleep. Some people may report brief periods of sleeplessness, but those who receive a diagnosis experience symptoms for months. It can be broken down into several subtypes.

The experience of stress in the environment can lead to periods of sleeplessness, with which therapies that reduce stress will also reduce difficulty sleeping. In other cases, it can be caused by an underlying medical condition. Abuse of certain substances or other underlying mental disorders can lead to periods of secondary insomnia.

**Sleep hygiene** refers to habits and behaviors conducive to sleeping well. Improvements to sleep hygiene may include:
* Reducing stimulant intake after noon
* Removing screens from the bedroom
* Relaxing or meditating before bed

Insomnia can be learned, through **conditioned insomnia**. Going to bed becomes associated with the inability to fall asleep, so cues that traditionally help a person relax, instead create tension and worry about falling asleep. 

**Idiopathic insomnia** (or child onset insomnia) results from neurophysiological abnormality in the central nervous system. This form of insomnia begins in childhood and is experienced through adulthood. We do not understand the causes, it is more resistant to treatment, and is difficult to diagnose, due to changing sleep needs at childhood.

## Hypersomnia
On the other hand, **hypersomnia** is excessive sleepiness, commonly caused by poor sleep quality during the night. **Sleep apnea** is a condition where intake of oxygen is reduced as the person sleep. Surgery is sometimes required for sleep apnea, and can be relieved by using a pressurized air mask called a CPAP. The machine pushes pressurized air through the airway as the person sleeps.

## Narcolepsy
A rare genetic neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by a sudden and extreme need to sleep. Sleep attacks are uncontrollable and can last between a few seconds to a few minutes. Upon waking, people report feeling alert and refreshed. In extreme forms, the individual enters a kind of REM sleep, losing all muscle tone while unconscious.

**Cataplexy** is another symptom, where paralysis typically experienced in REM sleep initiates at inappropriate times. Individuals experience extreme sensations of muscle weakness, or in some cases complete paralysis. Cataplexy is often initiated by emotionally engaging events, like arguments, laughter, and even sex.

Patients can experience paralysis accompanied by vivid sensory hallucinations.
* **Hypnogogic hallucinations** occur just before falling asleep
* **Hypnopompic hallucinations** occur just before waking up from sleep

 Hallucinations can be terrifying, with patients reporting not being able to move or cry out, but feeling their heat beat quickly in their chest as sinister forces close in around them. Can occur in individuals without narcolepsy, and most people will experience at least one episode in their lives.

## REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder
A neurodegenerative disorder where the brain is unable to effectively paralyze the body during sleep, and patients act out the contents of their dreams. Treatments include minor tranquilizers or anxiolytics such as Clonazepam. Melatonin and antidepressants also reduce or eliminate the disturbance.

## Slow-wave Sleep Disorders
Disorders can occur in slow-wave sleep, and most frequently occur in children. Symptoms include:
* **Bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis)** - Can be treated by using a small alarm that sounds at the first signs of moisture on bed sheets
* **Sleepwalking (somnambulism)** - Not acting out a dream, but acting behaviours as if they were awake.
* **Night terrors** - Frantic, panicked screaming during sleep, often little or no memory of what caused the episode.

## Circadian Rhythm
Daily clocks that tell us when to wake and sleep. If we're locked in a room with artificial light, we would start waking up a bit latter and going to bed a little later each day. Our "free running" cycle is closer to 25 hours than 24, and relies on access to time cues called **zeitgebers** to provide information about the time of day.

In areas like the Arctic, people experience prolonged darkness in winter months and continuous daylight in the summer. Sleep and mood disturbances occur more frequently, with people wanting to sleep for longer in the winter, and an inability to fall asleep in the summer.

Light signals from the eye split in the center of the brain at the **optic chiasm**. Above the chiasm is the **suprachiasmatic nucleus**, which is the body's "timekeeper". It sends signals to several regions of the brain, including the **pineal gland**, which secretes melatonin based on the light/dark cycle. We can chemically regular the clock, by taking melatonin before bedtime.
