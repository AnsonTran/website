# Occipital Lobes
Primarily concerned with processing light stimuli.
* The optic nerves originate in the retina of the eye
* Nerves cross (decussate) partially at the optic chiasma, and end up at the primary visual cortex

## Primary Visual Cortex
Information for the opposite side of the visual field ends up at the primary visual cortex. Damage to this area can cause **scitoma**, a hole in a persons visual field.

## Visual Association Cortex
The visual association cortex provides an interface between visual input and memory, allowing you to categorize visual images. Damage to the area causes **agnosia**, the inability to name common objects.

> Patients with damage in this region can describe objects clearly when relying only on visual information. However, when they are asked what the object is, they fail to comprehend it. After being able to touch it, they would recognize the object.
