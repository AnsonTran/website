# Implicit Memory
We can sometimes remember information without consciously realizing it or intending to. The information was **recalled implicitly**, and the information is an **implicit memory**.

Implicit memory can be assessed by determining whether a person's actions or responses are influenced by previous experience, without specifically asking the person to recall the experience.

## Roediger Study
Roediger study aims to measure the presence of implicit memories behaviourally.
1. Participants are presented with words and have to count the total number of different kinds of letters in the word, without realizing that they will be quizzed.
2. Afterwards, they are presented with word stem completion task. (i.e. ELE_____ can be ELEPHANT or ELEVATOR)
3. Roughly 40% of the word stems could be completed with words from the first phase

Participants were not aware of the link between the two phases, but were more likely to complete the word stems with words from the first phase.

The elaborative [[13.3-Long-Term Memory#Encoding Strategies|encoding strategies]] for explicit memories often have no effect on implicit memory. This could show that explicit and implicit memories are governed by different systems in the brain.
