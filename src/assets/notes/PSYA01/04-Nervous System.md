# Nervous System
The dendrites and axons of 80-90 billion neurons in the brain form trillions of connections, in a **neural network**. Axons from many neurons are bundled into a tube called a **nerve**, that can extend a large distance. These axons extend from cell bodies housed in the **central nervous system**, which consists of the brain and spinal cord.

Axons called **efferents** carry electrical impulses away from the CNS to trigger neurotransmitter or hormone releases in an organ or muscle.

Other axons, called **afferents**, carry impulses back to the CNS from organs and muscles.

## Automatic vs Voluntary
Many processes that occur in our brains and bodies are automatic. For example, we don't have to consciously remember to breathe, digest dinner, or pump blood into and out of the heart. As a result, the brain is divided into two sections:
* **Neocortex** - The outer layer of the brain, where conscious thinking and high-level processing occurs
* **Medulla** - A structure in the brainstem that helps control basic life-support functions like breathing, heart rate, and reflexes
> People in a comatose state are still able to maintain life functions, but can't respond to others or move

We do still have some conscious control over these functions. Thoughts and fears can shift, or modulate, the function of the heart and lungs.

## Central Nervous System
All the cells and supporting structures inside the skull and vertebral column (brain and spinal cord).
* **Spinal cord** - Simple reflex-level processing and communication with peripheral nerves in the body.
* **Gray matter** - Neurons and glia, which perform local processing of information
* **White matter** - Bundles of myelinated axons, which help different areas of the brain share information by connection neurons via axons and dendrites

## Peripheral Nervous System
Nerves outside of the skull and vertebral column, as well as specialized sensory endings (retinal cells, touch receptors, hair cells in the ear, etc.). The peripheral nervous system is split into two divisions:
1. **Somatic** - Neurons and nerves that control the muscles for voluntary movement, and bring sensory information from the body to the brain
2. **Autonomic** - Regulates all the automatic functions that keep you alive

## Autonomic Nervous System
The autonomic is further divided into to divisions:
1. **Sympathetic** - Reactions relating to nervousness or being frightened. Blood flow is routed towards all systems that help fight or escape and away from digestion, growth, or repair.
	* Increased heart rate
	* Pumping blood to the muscles
	* Narrowing visual field
	* Increased sweat due to rising body temperature
2. **Parasympathetic** - Transmit commands to your organs to help you recover, digest, and become sexually aroused.
