# Neocortex
The neocortex is responsible for higher-order processing, and is made up of four lobes, which all work together. Neurons in each lobe grow axons that connect to the others directly or indirectly through lower brain structures. 

The neocortex has a distinctive *wrinkled* or *tree bark* appearance that we are used to seeing. Its structure allows us to fit more brain into a small space, and has three distinct features:
* Gyri (ridges)
* Sulci (valleys)
* Fissures (space between lobes)

Within each lobe, there is a primary cortex and a complementary association cortex:
* **Primary cortex** - Where raw input from the world goes. Direct sensory or motor connections.
* **Association cortex** - Interpretation of sensory inputs via memory. Compares input to things it has seen before, and tries to recognize it.

> Notice in 'HAT', the raw inputs for 'H' and 'A' are the same. The association cortex recognizes this text as 'THE CAT IN THE HAT'

## Lateralization of Function
Although we talk about the brain as having four cortexes, it really has eight. The brain has two almost symmetrical hemispheres. A bundle of nerves between them, called the **corpus callosum**, connects the two sides and allows them to communicate instantaneously between them.
