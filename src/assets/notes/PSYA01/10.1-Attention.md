# Attention
The brain receives a tremendous amount of information at any given moment. **Attention** is the process of selecting information from the internal and external environments to prioritize for processing.

Attention can be involuntary and automatic, in the case of **passive attention**. This occurs when bottom-up information from the external environment requires a response. For example, when you hear a loud noise in a quiet room.

**Active attention** is attention directed by goals and top-down processing. For example, when searching a cluttered table for your keys.

## Selective Attention
**Selective attention** occurs when you attend to one source of information while simulataneously ignoring other stimuli. For instance, we are more likely to attent to a bright light in a dim scene or a loud noise in a quite room. These low-level properties are referred to as **stimulus salience**, the bottom-up qualities of a scene that influence how we direct attention. When attention is captured because of the salience of a stimulus, this is called **attentional capture**.

> Stimulus salience is used to direct your attention

Situations associated with selective attention can be described as the **cocktail party effect**. At a party, people can be engaged in a conversation by suppressing/ignoring information going on around them. However, this doesn't mean that information outside the conversation isn't being processed. If someone in the crowd calls your name, you would reorient your attnention to respond.

While we're focusing our attention on something, processing of other information is reduced, in an effect called **inhibition**.

## Dichotic Listening Task
The dichotic listening task tries to measure the cocktail party effect. Participants are asked to wear a pair of headphones that plays one message in one ear, and a different message in the other ear. Participants are asked to attend to and repeat one message and ignore the second.

> Participants focus on the attended inputs, while recalling very little of what happened in the unattended inputs.

Specific kinds of unattended information do get processed, and can be recalled. Usually, participants would notice if a male speaker changes to a female speaker in the unattended ear.

## Intentional Change Detection
Intentional change detection is a flicker task, where participants are actively looking for changes. Participants are shown two variations of a picture, with usually one difference between the two.
1. The first image is shown briefly, followed by a white screen
2. The second version is shown briefly, followed by a white screen.

Participants often require a substantial amount of time to locate changes. People are far quicker at identifying changes to animate stimuli compared to inanimate stimuli. Objects that don't belong in a scene, like a fire hydrant in the living room, are noticed quickly. 

### Corteen and Wood (1972)
A dichotic listening task, that examines in part, the degree to which unattended information is processed. In preconditioning, participants are presented a list of city names followed by a mild shock. Following this, participants complete a dichotic listening task. The message played in the unattended ear included city names paired with shock, as well as new cities and other nouns. 

**Galvanic skin response** (GSR) measurements were taken, which measures the arousal level of the sympathetic nervous system. It responds when you hear something startling or emotionally engaging.

City names paired with shock exhibited a response in 38% of the trials, city names not paired with a show in 23% of the trials, and unrelated words in 10% of the trials. Suggests that information in the unattended ear was processed by the auditory system and identified as meaningful some of the time.

## Divided Attention
Also called multitasking, divided attention is when we simultaneously attend to two or more tasks at the same time. For example, talking with a friend while driving.

**Automaticity** refers to fast and effortless processing that can be accomplished without conscious thought. With enough practice, tasks can become **automatic**, where they are not impaired by other tasks.

Automatic tasks can vary in the predictability of performing the task. Typing on a keyboard is very predictable, since the positioning of the keys don't change. Driving a car on the other hand, are variable experiences with deadly consequences. Talking on the phone while driving leads to slower reaction times, missed traffic signals, etc.

**Inattentional blindness** occurs when we try to engage in multiple complex tasks. We are engaged in one task, but completely miss other information.

### Rosenbloom (2006)
Observed driving performance under two conditions:
1. Participants driving without using a cell phone
2. Participants receiving a call on a hands-free phone

Participants while on a call, left smaller distances between cars in front, were more likely to increase speed, and were unaware that their driving had changed.

## Subliminal and Subconscious Messages
A **subliminal stimulus** is sensory stimulus that is processed but does not reach the threshold for conscious preception. This information is being processed even if we are unaware that we experienced it. What we want to know is how much these stimuli influence our behaviour.

**Subconscious processing** is information we are aware of, but not necessarily aware that it is influencing our behaviour. 

**Subliminal processing** is information we cannot consciously detect, even if we were looking for it. These messages include:
* **Subvisual messages** - Messages presented too quickly for the visual system to perceive
* **Subaudible messages** - Messages played at a low volume, typically with a louder message played over it.

### North, Hargreaves, and McKendrick (1999)
A study found that if French music played in a liquor store, people were more likely to purchase French wine than German wine. On the other hand, if German music is played, German wine is purchased more often. Participants were aware that they were listening to music, but not aware that it was influencing their behaviour.

### Rosen and Singh (1992)
Results show subliminal messages have minimal to no effect on behaviour. In a study, participants looked at printed advertisements for liquor and cologne. Some images had embedded images of naked women, skulls, etc., while others had no subliminal messages. The presence of these messages did not seem to affect participants opinion of the product.

### Merikle and Skanes (1992)
A study on subaudible messages showed they also had minimal effects on behaviour. Participants were divided into three groups:
1. Listened to tapes with subaudible messages encouraging them to lose weight
2. Listened to an identical tape with no subaudible messages
3. Were not given a tape
All three groups lost weight, and there were no differences between control and experiment groups.

Participants consistently chose the image that was not on fire, but could not articulate the reason why.
