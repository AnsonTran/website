# Life Functions
These parts of the brain are responsible for maintaining basic life functions, and are found in all animals.
* Regulate basic life functions in the background
* Connect the peripheral and central nervous systems to regulate what we do and pay attention to

## Medulla Oblongata
The medulla is the lowest anatomical portion of the brain, and transitions between the brain and spinal cord. Without the medulla:
* You cannot breathe
* Your heart would not beat
* You wouldn't be able to swallow

Damage to the upper spinal cord can be fatal, since neurons in the medulla and cervical spinal cord perform these life functions.

## Pons
Information from the spinal cord enters the medulla and is then transferred to the pons, and to higher-order brain functions. The pons:
* Regulates arousal (level of excitement, energy)
* Coordinate the senses with the cerebellum
* Bridges tracts from the upper brain to the lower brain/spinal cord
* Houses neurons that control facial expressions and eye movement
* Vestibulocochlear nerve enters the brain here, which originates in the inner ear and helps your brain sense orientation and regulates left-rigth coordination

## Reticular Activating System
Network of neurons spanning the center of the medulla and pons.
* Bridges the functions of the body and brain through connections to the spinal cord and thalamus
* Regulates level of arousal (excitement, energy)
* Regulates focus of attention on tasks, people, or objects

In normal situations, the RAS filters out irrelevant stimuli constantly. Dysfunction here is a possible contributor to ADHD.
