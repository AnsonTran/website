# Long-Term Memory
Long-term memory stores and recalls information over lengthy periods of time.

## Declarative Memory
**Episodic** and **semantic** memories are classified under declarative memory. Your first exposure to a piece of information is episodic, since you're learning it for the first time. After repeated exposure to that piece of information across multiple contexts, the bits of episodic memory can transform into semantic memory.

### Episodic Memories
Memories pertaining to life events are **episode memories**. These are based on specific events that you've experienced and encoded.

> Can be anything from a special birthday event, or what you did yesterday night

### Semantic Memories
Memories pertaining to facts, or a piece of knowledge about the world. It is devoid of a specific context.

> When you're remembering what a dog looks like, you don't think back to when you're learning about it in primary school

## Non-Declarative Memory
### Procedural Memory
Memories pertaining to the process of how a task is completed. People can physically perform these tasks, but may not be able to explain the process in words. Procedural memories are particularly resistant to amnesia, suggesting that it works on a different level from episodic and semantic memory.

> Playing basketball, typing, tying your shoes, etc. Good coaches likely have better insight to these procedural memories than bad coaches

## Immediate to Long-Term
Information is effectively remembered through **elaborative rehearsal**, actively manipulating information in immediate memory so that we can meaningfully connect to other information that we've already stored in long-term memory. 

**Deep processing** involves making meaningful connections to existing knowledge, versus **shallow processing**, encoding information based on its surface characteristics.

> The meaning of the word CHIPMUNK, versus whether the word is in all capital letters

## Encoding Strategies
There are also various ways to structure the encoding process to ensure effective learning occurs:
3. Techniques that naturally fit well with the function of our brains
4. Retrieval practice

### Spacing
**Massed practice**, or cramming, refers to frantically studying for an exam by rereading notes the night before an exam. This isn't effective for performance over the longer term, since repeating the same material over a short time period yields diminishing returns.

Instead, the **spacing effect** shows that learning should be spread out over multiple hours, days, weeks, or months.

### Mnemonics
A framework used to help you engage in meaningful processing as discussed earlier.
1. Peg word technique - Provides order and imagery to a list of items
2. Loci method - Place to-be-remembered information along a well-known pathway. The route provides structure to the information, while imagining the route provides meaningful memory.
3. Phrases, acronyms, and initializations can be cues to the information's organizational structure.

### Adaptive Memory
Use techniques that naturally fit well with the structure of our brains. 
* Information relevant to our own survival leads to high levels of later recall
* Certain types of information are privileged (living animate things are more memorable than non-living, inanimate things)

### Retrieval Practice
Retrieving information is helpful for trying to remember it later. When retrieving, the relationship between the memory and the cues that help us retrieve it is enhanced.
