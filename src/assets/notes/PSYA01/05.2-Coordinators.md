# Coordinators
A network of neurons and glia in the limbic system, basal ganglia, and cerebullum.
* Designed to be modifiers of action and thought
* Collecting information encoded by impulses from other areas of the central nervous system
* Help cortical circuits modify high-level commands. 
* Help us adjust on the fly after areas like the prefrontal cortex make decisions

## Limbic System
The Limbic system helps regulate endocrine systems as well as emotions and emotional memory. Includes circuits in the cortex (telencephalon) and the midbrain (mesencephalon). It contains:
* The prefrontal cortex
* Olfactory (smell) cortex
* Amygdala
* Hippocampus
* Cingulate gyrus
* Hypothalamus

### Amygdala
The amygdala receives sensory input from all senses, and uses this information to make calculations about emotional value and intensity of a stimulus. The outputs connect with many areas, including the hippocampus and thalamus, for formation of emotional memories and to coordinate behavior.
* Increases electrical activitiy in its neurons when under threat.
* Involved in aggression responses to threats and romantic love
* Increases secretion of norepinephrine (adrenalin) in the body during fight or flight response
* Forms memories associated with events tied to strong emotions

In amygdalectomy, destruction of the amygdala in animals, makes them docile. Humans with damage to this area lose awareness of their own emotionss, and respond inappropriately in situations that normally trigger emotional responses

### Hippocampus
Circular structure medial to the temporal lobes, set up as a loop of neurons that are activated when we form memories. 
* When exposed to high-frequency stimulation over time, the hippocampal synapses strengthen, making more receptors and neurotransmitters
* Essential for formation of new memories, and imagination of new possibilities
* Repeatedly activating its neurons is necessary for cataloging new experiences

Patient H.M. whom had cracked his skull as a kid and experienced frequent seizures, went through a surgery to remove the hippocampus. H.M. lost memories from the previous decade, as well as being unable to form new ones.

### Cingulate Gyrus
The cingulate gyrus (telencephalon) sees increased activity when experiencing physical pain and when they are excluded socially. Helps focus our attention and thoughts on unpleasant things, which we associate with potential damage and death.

### Hypothalamus
Helps control several functions in the autonomic and endocrine systems. Responsible for regulating:
* Hunger responses
* Sexual behavior
* Temperature
* Aggression

## Basal Ganglia
The basal ganglia (telencephalon and diencephalon) are several groups of neuronal circuits near the base of the brain that help coordinate movement. Helps us learn to make complex movements more automatic. Consists of:
* Dorsal striatum (caudate nucleus and putamne)
* Ventral striatum (nucleus accumens)
* Globus pallidus
* Substantia nigra
* Subthalamic nucleus

The basal ganglia have two circuits that process input and coordinate output.
* Direct pathway - Provides an excitatory effect on the thalamus, driving motor behavior. Facilitates motor plans that are appropriate for the present situation
* Indirect pathway - Has a net inhibitory effect on its targets. Helps shut down motor plans that are not right for the task at hand.

### Striatum
Here, input to the basal ganglia comes in from all over the cortex, coordinating multiple streams of information.

The ventral striatum neurons synapse with axons from the limbic system. Emotion is often a motivation to learn, a set of networks that help us learn would get a boost from emotion circuits.

### Globus Pallidus and Substantia Nigra
Sends inhibitory outputs to the thalamus to help integrate sensory and motor information with motor planning. Helps the basal ganglia shut down inappropriate motor plans.

> In Parkinson's disease, neurons in the substantia nigra die off. These are dopaminergic, meaning that the axons secrete dopamine. This cuases people to have difficulty initiating and terminating movements.

## Cerebellum
The cerebellum (metencephalon) is a rhythm and timing machine. The neuronal circuits are connected with other parts of the brain to modify what they do, especially for movement and cognitive tasks. It simultaneously receives and organizes input from multiple central nervous system networks. It is divided into three divisions:
* **Spinocerebellar** - Helps match sensory input with motor plans to fine-tune movement patterns.
* **Vestibulocerebellar** - Processes information from the inner eat to help adjust your posture and balance
* **Cerebrocerebellar** - Manages connections with the pons and thalamus to adjust the timing and planning of movements.

Injuries or maldevelopment in the cerebellum result in loss of balance or uncoordinated gait (walking). Problems in the cerebellum does not result in paralysis. Instead, the person's timing, planning, and balance is altered.

## Thalamus
The thalamus (diencephalon) is arranged and connected to help us associate one sense with another. Each cluster of neurons corresponds to a particular set of functions and locations in some part of the brain. While the [[05.1-Life Functions#Reticular Activating System|reticular activating system]] determines the level of arousal and amount of attention, the thalamus is used by the cortex to choose what thing we pay attention to.

All senses, except smell, passes through the thalamus before being relayed to the neocortex for higher-order functions. Axons from the spinal cord and cranial nerves, carrying impulses from the eyes, ears, skin, muscles and joints, first synapse in the thalamus.
