# Sensory Memory
System that keeps information translated by the senses briefly active in a relatively unaltered, unexamined form. Information is held long enough for us to stitch one moment of experience to the next.

Sensory memory is thought to be fed into the intermediate memory, a system that actively holds onto a limited amount of information so we can manipulate and process it.

**Iconic memory** in the visual system, is the fleeting afterimages, and the neuronal activity that loiters in our brains is an **icon**. Lasts only a few tenths of a second.

**Echoic memory** in the auditory system, is the fleeting sounds, and the lingering neuronal activity is called an **echo**. Lasts only a few tenths of a second. However, in some comes up to 3-4 seconds.

## George Sperling (1960)
Conducted an experiment to figure out how long sensory flashes linger for. Presented participants with blocks of letters as such:

Participants shown blocks for one twentieth of a second, and asked to remember as many as they could. They could generally remember only half of them accurately. This shows that they had seen the letters, but the information faded too quickly for them to put it into words.

In another experiment, he used *partial report technique*, by playing a tone that indicated to participants which row to remember. The tone was played after the letter display was turned off, but the icon was still available. Participants had almost no problems remembering letters.
