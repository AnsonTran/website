# Temporal Conditioning
Excitatory conditioning occurs when a conditional stimulus is presented before the unconditional stimulus:
1. **Short-Delayed Conditioning** - Unconditional stimulus occurs within a few seconds of the start of the conditional stimulus. The most effective excitatory conditioning procedure.
2. **Long-Delayed Conditioning** - Unconditional stimulus occurs after the conditional stimulus has been there for a while. Doesn't easily pinpoint when the unconditional stimulus will occur
3. **Trace Conditioning** - Unconditional stimulus occurs minutes or hours after the conditional stimulus has stopped. You eat gas station sushi hours before feeling the effects of salmonella. With stimuli other than food, the events are so far apart they seem to have no relation.

Inhibitory conditioning occurs when a conditional stimulus is presented at the same time or after the unconditional stimulus, in which a conditional response is suppressed:
1. **Simultaneous Conditioning** - Unconditional stimulus occurs with the start of the conditional stimulus. The unconditional stimulus doesn't allow you to predict anything about a conditional stimulus.
2. **Backwards Conditioning** - Unconditional stimulus occurs a few seconds before the conditional stimulus. You might hear thunder before you see lightning. Then, the lightning tells you that thunder won't occur.

## Taste Aversion Learning
A type of trace conditioning, where we eat food and experience illness several hours later. The next time the food is encountered, we would want to avoid that food, quite often feeling ill all over again:
* Conditional stimulus - Taste of food
* Conditional response - Nausea
* Unconditional stimulus - Illness-causing bacteria
* Unconditional response - Sickness

This conditioning helps us avoid food that makes us sick. It can develop with a single pairing, tends to be long lasting, and resistant to extinction.
