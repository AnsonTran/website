# Latent Learning
Learning that we can't see until we're motivated to show it. In other words, there is no change in our performance until we receive a reward. 

Whereas behaviorism only focused on observable behaviors, researchers such as Edward C. Tolman wanted to emphasize thoughts and feelings, in order to understand complex behavior.

He reintroduced mental events in the form of **cognitive maps**, which are detailed representation of the physical environment and all possible routes that we can use when deciding where to go.

## Tolman and Honzik (1930)
Tolman is famous for his experiment on latent learning using rats running through T-mazes (mazes shaped like a T).
1. Rats placed inside a 14-unit T-maze
2. Rats could turn down 14 incorrect paths
4. Food group - Rats in this group received food when they reached the end of the maze and made fewer errors than No Food group.
3. No Food group - Rats in this group did not receive food for the first 10 days.  On the eleventh day, they would receive food at the end of the maze.

On the eleventh day, the No Food group rats made fewer errors and ran faster than the rats that had always received food. The rats were actively constructing cognitive maps of the maze, improving their maze performance over the Food group rats. They could take the learned route, as well as use shorter, alternate routes.
