# Memory
Memory refers to the structures and processes involved in the storage and retrieval of information. In constrast, "*a memory*" refers to a recollection of an event.

The way we talk about memories, is through a **search metaphor**.
Examples include:
* Searching the rooms of a house
* Looking through the shelves of a library for a book
* Checking through a purse for an object.

The inability to remember something is described as a **failure of search**.

Our memory systems do not record the world around us, allowing for a "search and retrieve system". Memory is much more about the present than the past, so a *memory reconstruction* is a better metaphor for memory.

## Memory Encoding
After the occurence of an event, our brain commits the event to memory in a process called **encoding**. The problem our brains solve in order to encode information is called the **encoding problem**.

## Memory Storage
Memories are then stored in the brain as part of its physical structure in a process called **storage**. Less like putting a book back on the shelf of a library, and more like taking apart a dinosaur skeleton.  The problem the brain solves in order to maintain information in the brain is the **storage problem**.

> Kayla is interested in neuroscience. She is interested in how the brain represents memories physically.

## Memory Retrieval
How we retrieve information. Its associated problem that the brain solves is the **retrieval problem**.

### Cues
Memory cues are pieces of information in the present that helps us remember events from the past. Cues can be specific or broad, and how diagnostic the cue is influences the likelihood that the information will be remembered.

When we encode information meaningfully, we create networks of cues that help us retrieve the information at a later date.

In studies, researchers often use:
* **Free recall** - Trying to recall studied information without help
* **Cued recall** - Trying to recall studied information with the help of cues (i.e. category that the item is in)

### Encoding Specificity Principle
How we encode information affects how we are able to retrieve it. Retrieval cues need to match how the information was originally encoded.

Suppose we were trying to remember these word pairs in a cued recall:

> RIVER-BANK
> DRINK-GLASS
> RULER-FOOT

Money, window, and toe would not act as good cues for the words on the right. Although they relate to the word, they relate to opposite meanings from the ones that we encoded them with.

### Transfer-Appropriate Processing
We should attempt to match the context that occurs at both encoding and retrieve, but also match the physical and mental processes that are occuring. 

> Multiple-choice tests require you to discriminate between answers to find the correct one. You should try to emulate this when studying.

## Memory Errors
Daniel Schacter provides an organizing framework for the kinds of memory errors that occur, called the *seven sins of memory*. These sins can be classified into **errors of omission**, and **errors of commission**.

## Errors of Omission
Memory errors where memories cannot be brought up to mind. Schacter believes that there are three types of errors of omissions:

### Transience
The memory for any particular event or piece of information degrades over time, often simply called forgetting. This could be due to the lack of cues to trigger the information, or new information interfering with older ones. 

**Interference** is a common factor that leads to transience. If new information conflicts with that of old information, then acquiring the new information makes the older information harder to recall. There are two types of interference:
1. **Retroactive interference** - Newly learned information makes it more difficult to recall older information
2. **Proactive interference** - Old information interferes with new information.

> An example of proactive interference, is if you park your car in the same spot everyday for work, old memories can interfere if you park somewhere else today.

### Absent-Mindedness
Information is not encoded, since it is not processed in meaningful, elaborate ways. Could be due to lack of attention or lack of rehearsal.

### Blocking
The cues we have available are not enough to help us remember a piece of information. An example are the incorrect cues given in [[13-Memory#Encoding Specificity Principle|encoding specificity principle]].


## Errors of Commission
Memory errors where wrong or unwanted information is brought to mind.

### Misattribution
Incorrectly recalling the source of the information we are trying to remember. For example, calling someone by the wrong name.

**Deja vu** is a feeling that you have already experienced a sequence of events, and is also an example of misattribution. This could be induced in a lab, by presenting participants with symbols subliminally. Some participants would experience deja vu when the symbols were shown later in the experiment.

**Flashbulb memories** are memories for events that are both surprising and particularly significant, such as 9/11, the assassination of Shinzo Abe, etc. We would have rich, elaborate stories of what we were doing when we heard the news.

While we may be confident that these memories are accurate, we are likely to misattribute things, since these memories weren't elaborately encoded and tinged with emotion.

### Suggestibility
Information may be misremembered if it is suggested by an outside source.

The **misinformation effect** causes us to misremember things, since the suggested information is a component of the question itself. As a result, questioners need to ask neutrally worded questions so that no assumptions are made about what happened.

> A witness to a robbery may be asked "Which hand was the robber holding his gun in?"
> The witness is likely to assume that the robber was male, and had a gun. 

### Bias
When we are trying to reconstruct a memory, information available to us when we are trying to remember can influence us, both from the world around us, and previously stored memories.

**Memory schemas** are highly organized sets of facts and knowledge about specific kinds of information. They are highly useful for remembering, and allow us to remember new information by fitting it into a set of knowledge that is already highly organized.

> Things found in a bathroom are: toilet, shower, mirror, tile flooring, is an example of a memory schema

Memory schemas can become overgeneralized, or exceptions to the schemas are not noticed, in which bias has occured.

> Participants are more likely to report higher speeds when asked when the two cars *smashed* into each other, rather than *contacted*. Each word provided access to different schemas.

### Persistence
The memory system fails to prevent the recall of a memory that is unwanted, typically negative or traumatic. Persistence occurs when memories come flooding back without warning.

> PTSD from sexual assault, wartime experiences, or threats on their lives, experience intrusive and disturbing thoughts that force them back to the original events.

## Forgetting
Forgetting helps us smooth over unpleasant events in our lives, and keep only information relevant to present circumstances.

Physical problems or damage to areas of the brain associated with memory (i.e. the hippocampus) can cause significant forgetting. Memory lost in this way is referred to as **amnesia**, and can come in two forms:
1. **Retrograde amnesia** - Events prior to the incident causing amnesia to develop are lost, typically only temporary. In most cases, the only events that are lost lead directly up to the event. In severe cases, patients could lose months or even years of time.
2. **Anterograde amnesia** - Inability to make new memories. Information after the injury is never encoded or stored. Only develops from specific brain damage to the hippocampus, from nasty viral infection, alcohol abuse over many years, or unintended consequence of brain surgery.
