# Sleep
Sleep can be thought of as an altered state of consciousness. While we do not appear to be doing much, the brain is quite active. Sleeping is a critical part of our lives, and is observed in all types of animals. A disorder called **fatal familial insomnia** affecting the thalamus causes individuals to die from lack of sleep, due to weight loss and an inability to maintain homeostatsis. 

Sleep can be studied in a sleep lab, where a large number of recordings are taking during sleep:
* **Electroencephalograms (EEGs)** - Measures activity across the surface of the brain
* **Electrooculograms** - Used to measure the movements of your eyes as you sleep
* **Electromyograms** - Used to measure the tension in the muscles of the jaw
Additionally, blood oxygenation and pulse will likely be monitored.

One possible explanation for why we sleep, is that humans rely heavily on vision during the day to look for food. During night, we want to conserve energy so that we can be active the next day.

On the other hand, an individual who can operate just as well with less sleep would probably be more successful. This indicates that sleep must do something important.

Using neuroimaging techniques, we find that the brain goes through several distinct and predictable changes throughout the night. These are measured based on the *frequency* of the waves, as well as the *amplitude*.

> **Beta activity** - Neural circuits in the brain are actively processing information
> **Alpha activity** - Brain is quiety resting and not thinking about anything too difficult or taxing
> **Theta activity** - Appears in the earliest stages of sleep, and signifies a transition to the first stage of sleep
> **Sleep spindles** - Brief bursts of activity, thought to play a role in memory consolidation
> **K-complexes** - Large period of coordinated excitation followed by neural inhibition. 
> **Delta activity** - Slow, regular, high amplitude waves. Each oscillation is a biphasic wave reflecting one period of neural inhibition and one period of excitation.

## Stages of Sleep
The brain goes through four different stages of sleep:
1. **Stage 1** - Very light stage of sleep, moving from a state of relaxation to early sleep; Firing rate across the cortex becomes more synchronized, and the brain transitions from alpha to theta waves.
2. **Stage 2** - You are soundly asleep. However, if woken, you would not necessarily have any sense that you had been asleep. Sleep spindles and K-complexes appear briefly.
3. **Slow Wave Sleep** - Firing across the cortex becomes coordinated. Referred to as the deepest stage of sleep. Only strong stimulus will wake you, and you will feel groggy and confused upon waking. Transition to delta activity.
4. **Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep** - Dreams occur in this stage. Your eyes start to move side to side beneath your closed eyelids, with the brain becomes highly active, similar to awakeness. We generally become paralyzed, although much easier to wake up than in slow-wave sleep if we hear something meaninful like your name.

Based on the hypnogram, we notice that we go through the stages in cycles. As the night goes on, we spend less time in deep sleep, and more time in REM.

## Physical Exertion
Early hypotheses suggested that sleep played a role in helping the body rest from physical exertion. This hypothesis was tested through measuring the performance of marathon runners who had flown in to a race, since these runners would be experience varying levels of jetlag and abnormal sleep. However, results show that quantity of sleep had minimal effect on runner's performance in marathons. 

We believe that since runner is something runner's have trained for, and has become an automatic task, that minimal processing has to be done by the brain since the limbic system is in control. As such, we believe that sleep is essential for resting the brain, and not necessarily for the body.

## Slow-Wave Sleep
Sleep can be studied by keeping people awake and measuring the effects of sleep deprivation on functioning. Slow-wave sleep is more important for restoring the brain than the rest of the body.

Studies show few differences in performance between sleep deprived and well-rested paprticipants in physical tasks. However, there are noticeable differences in coginitive function. Without sleep, people become irritable, disoriented, and have more difficult completing cognitive tasks. After a few days without sleep, people report symptoms that include mild hallucinations.

During slow-wave sleep, metabolic rate and blood flow to the cortex decline substantially relative to wakefulness. Regions of the brain with highest activity during waking hours show a great reduction in metabolic activity and the most delta activity during slow-wave sleep.

Slow-wave sleep seems to be important for maintaining explicit memories.

## REM Sleep
Due to the physiological responses of REM (rapid movement of eyes), we believe that REM sleep serves different functions from slow-wave sleep.

To study the effects, researches wake people up just as the brain transitions from slow-wave sleep to REM. If the brain is deprived of REM for a few days, the **rebound phenomenon** occurs, in which the brain tries to enter REM more quickly and spends proportionally more time in REM. We see an increase in the percentage of time in REM during periods of intense brain development, such as human babies, as compared to animals that mature more quickly.

REM sleep seems to be important in helping us consolidate information and learning new skills, as measured in some studies.

## Dreams
During sleep, the body releases a different set of hormones than the ones released during awake hours. As a result, dreams tend to fade away quickly when we wake, as our body is switching the types of hormones being released.

### Sigmund Freud
Dreams were initially studied by Sigmund Freud. He believes that patients who were feeling problems in their lives reflected some deep-seeded issue in the lives. These problems were so painful for them, that unconscious processes have kept it from their awareness. 

Manifest content is what you actually report in a dream journal. However, he believes the manifest content could contain some hidden symbols, or latent content.

### Activation Synthesis Hypothesis
Activation-synthesis hypothesis suggests the experience of dreaming has no explicit or reliable meaning. It is a consequence of the other processes that occur during the cortex during sleep. This model is supported by the disorganized and bizarre events in sleep, with the higher brain trying to interpret disorganized lower brain activity and attribute meaning to it.

### Evolutionary Hypothesis of Dreams
Evolutionary hypothesis of dreams suggests that dreams do have some meaning and an evolutionary purpose. Revonsu (2000) argues we often dream about things related to survival, which leads to enhanced performance when encountering threatening events.
