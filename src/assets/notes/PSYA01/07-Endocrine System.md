# Endocrine System
A series of glands throughout the body that releases hormones. It serves as a secondary control system that gives feedback to the nervous system about what is happening in the body. Hormones secreted can also act as neurotransmitters.
* **Hypothalamus** - Secretes hormones and controls the pituitary gland via direct nerve stimulation/chemicals 
* **Pineal Gland** - Secretes melatonin to regulate sleep cycles 
* **Pituitary Gland** - Secretes a host of hormones that affect sexual behavior, reproduction, circulatory function, hunger, and responses to aggression.

## HPA Axis
The **hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis** is activated in times of stress.
1. The hypothalamus is activated
2. Signals the pituitary to release hormones
3. Hormones trigger the adrenal glands to release cortisol, the stress hormone

For people experiencing chronic stress
1. Neurons in the hypothalamus become more active more often
2. Drives the pituitary to tell the adrenal glands to produce more cortisol

In short doses, stress drives energy and blood flow to the muscles and increases alertness. In chronic stress, we end up fatigued, storing more fat, and becoming less alert over time.
