# Behaviorism
Behaviorism focuses on how we learn new behaviors and how they change across different situations. It is credited to John B. Watson, who believes psychology should be limited to phenomena that could be accurately measured.

> Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I'll guarantee to take anyone at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select - doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and, yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors. I am going beyond my facts and I admit it, but so have the advocates of the contrary and they have been doing it for many thousands of years (Watson, 1930)

## Little Albert
A nine-month-old baby in Watson's study, who developed a Pavlovian fear response to furry, white objects.
1. Little Albert was shown a variety of animals such as dogs, rabbits, white rabbits, and objects such as fire and fur coat
2. Albert was not afraid, and seemed to like the white rat
3. Iron bar struck with hammer when Albert is shown the white rat
4. Albert started crying at just the sight of the white rat
5. Albert's fear generalized to objects similar to the white rat (rabbit, dog, fur coat).
6. Albert's fear did not generalize to some white objects (Watson's hair, Watson in a Santa mask, cotton wool)
7. Planned to use systematic desensitization to remove fear of furry animals and objects, but they had left

## Systematic Desensitization
At extreme levels, conditional fears can interfere with day-to-day functioning, at which it becomes a **phobia**. Systematic desensitization is a therapeutic treatment for phobias based on Pavlovian conditioning, developed by Joseph Wolpe (1958). 

It is a type of [[12.1-Psychological Treatment#Behavioral Cognitive Therapy|behavioral therapy]], and involves repeated exposure to the stimulus, leading to a reduction in the threat response.
