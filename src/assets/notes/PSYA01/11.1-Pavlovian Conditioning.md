# Pavlovian Conditioning
Pavlovian conditioning occurs when we associate a signal with what's being signaled.

## Unconditioned
Many stimulus response mappings don't need to be learned, and reflect our machinery in action:
* When we put food in our mouths, digestive processes are initiated
* If a projectile comes at our face, we close our eyes, duck our heads, raise our hands, and sometimes hold our breath

These associations are the product of evolution (or creation) and the components of them are labeled as **unconditioned stimuli (UCS)** and **unconditioned responses (UCR)**. UCS and UCR can be thought of as a pair, since they cannot exist without the other.

## Habituation
The occurrence of novel stimulus in the environment tends to lead to a startle response. However, if the stimulus occurs repeatedly without positive or negative consequence, the startle response stops occurring. For example:
* Weird house noises you no longer hear
* Airplanes that occasionally fly over your house
* A dog ignoring its reflection

## Pavlov's Experiment
Pavlov noticed that although we are born with a set of SR mappings, we can learn a set of new behaviors. Pavlov's experiment goes as follows:
* **Baseline** - If a bell is rung near the dog it would not salivate. However, if food (UCS) is presented, it would salivate (UCR).
* **Conditioning** - Over a number of trials, the bell (conditioned stimulus) is rung just before the food is delivered. Lots of drooling.
* **Testing** - After a number of conditioning trials, the CS is presented alone. Typically leads to a conditioned response, similar to the unconditioned stimulus, but typically less extreme (drooling but less).

## Extinction
During conditioning, we learn to respond to a conditional stimulus when it reliably signals an unconditional stimulus. However, it loses some associative strength when presented without the unconditional stimulus.

## Spontaneous Recovery
If the conditional stimulus is presented multiple times without the unconditional stimulus, we learn not to react to the conditional stimulus. However, the original association is not forgotten.
* A conditional stimulus presented alone after a period of rest would elicit a conditional response
* One instance after extinction of CS+UCS pairing would rebound the strengh of the conditional response

## Stimulus Generalization
We may respond similarly to conceptually or physically similar stimuli. An event that has not been paired with the unconditional stimulus also elicits or causes the conditional response.

> A person being bit by a brown recluse spider may develop a fear of all spiders. They may also fear things like webs, attics, or basements.

## Stimulus Discrimination
The opposite of stimulus generalization, responding differently to different events. Conditional responses only occur when the original conditional stimulus is introduced.

> A person being bit by a brown recluse spider may fear brown recluse spiders, but not wolf spiders or tarantulas.

## Overview
The brain is constantly using past experience to make predictions about future events, and is preparing the body to behave in advance.
1. In order for classical conditioning to be effective, the UCS must reliably follow the CS
2. If the association is not strong throughout the conditioning phase, the learning will be weak
3. **Extinction** - If the association between the CS and UCS is terminated after conditioning, the CR will eventually not occur in response to the CS
4. **Spontaneous Recovery** - An extinct CS-CR mapping can become active again quickly if the CS/UCS association becomes strong again

## Higher-Order Conditioning
Higher-order conditioning takes place after normal Pavlovian conditioning. Afterwards, a neutral stimulus is systematically and repeatedly paired with a conditional stimulus that reliably elicits the conditional response.

> A person who is afraid of clowns after a bad experience might then become afraid of red balloons if they are repeatedly presented with clowns.
