## Language Development
At birth, young children undergo a relatively rapid rate of language acquisition. They would be more receptive to their father's voice compared to other voices, such as doctors.

|Milestone|Average Age of Attainment (months)|Developmental Implications|
|---|---|---|
|Smiles in response to face/voice|1.5|More active social participation|
|Babbles|6|Experimentation with sound|
|Inhibits to "no"|7|Response to tone|
|Follows one step command when said with gesture|7|Response to gesture|
|Follows one step verbal command when said without gesture|10|Verbal receptive language|
|Monosyllabic-mama/dada|10|Expressive language|
|Points to object|10|Interactive communication|
|Speaks first real word|12|Beginning of labelling|
|Speaks 4-6 words|15|Learns names of objects and people|
|Speaks 10-15 words|18|Learns names of objects and people|
|Makes 2 word sentences|19|Grammatization, 50+ words vocabulary|

As early as 8 months old, babies begin to show a declined ability to distinguish between sounds not commonly used in their native language.

Different languages can have an impact on the child as they're growing up:
* **Tones** - Tones can be used to convey different meanings (vietnamese, mandarin), or convey feelings (english)
* **Grammar** - The general rules of a language
* **Syntax** - Structure and order of words within a language

## Nurture
B.F. Skinner argued that environmental influences strongly dictated language development. He urged that human study should focus on behavior, since it is directly observable, and objectively measurable.

Skinner defined speech as **verbal behavior**, and applies theories of operant conditioning to language acquisition.  
* Children began to gesture or utter phrases, and repeated those phrases if reinforced.
* Undesirable behaviors would decrease, if followed by a punishment.
* Higher pitched tones elicit smiles from babies, while low, warning tones elicit frowns
* Talking more slowly to babies helps those struggling to produce words
* Mothers that encourage, priase, or elaborate on play behaviour, have children that reach language milestones faster
* Fathers positive interaction and engagement benefits language and cognitive development

However, these do not explain the rapid development of human language in early childhood.

## Nature
Noam Chomsky urged for the consideration of biological constraints on development. Nativists searched for a **Language Acquisition Device** in the brain, a hypothetical mechanism responsible for language, although it was not found.

Studies across many different cultures show children acquire nouns faster than verbs, since they rely on them more.

Grammatical structure of languages vary little between cultures, so patterns in grammar can be observed early in development. Congenitally deaf children are seen spontaneously developing language using the SOV order:
1. **SOV** - Subject, object, verb. Boy water dumps.
2. **SVO** - Subject, verb, object. Boy dumps water.

Gesturing patterns originate in SOV order, but deviate to others depending on environmental or cultural influences.

### Critical Period
At birth, our brains appear *ready* to acquire language. For young children, learning is effortless, but this readiness does not last.
* Babies undergo a relatively slow period of acquisition until 7-12 months
* A shift occurs, and babies absorb words at a lightning pace until around age 5

This period is known as a **critical period** for language development. Children who are not exposed to as much auditory information perform worse than others.

Learning another language after the critical period is still possible, but much harder.

## Emergentist
An emergentist perspective attempts to bridge the divide between nature and nurture.
* Newborn and infant babies show a preference for speech sounds compared to non-speech sounds
* 6-month-old babies can discriminate between phonemes better than adults. Shows an ability to learn language, and initial flexibility to learn any language

A nativist approach would focus heavily on how inherited speech bias and early flexibility prepare us to learn language

An environmental perspective would emphasize that speech development is dependent on exposure to, and familiarity with, our native language.
