# Frontal Lobes
Tasked with decision making and movement. An intact frontal lobe is necessary for maintaining out ability to regulate behavior and thought. 
* Neurons here are active when making decisions about how to act or what to do
* Seems to help encode our personalities
* Output tends to be inhibitory

## Motor Cortex
The motor cortex houses the primary neurons that initiate voluntary movement. Gives rise to two major pathways. These are bundles of axons that:
1. Corticospinal - Control movement of the muscles in the body (spinal)
2. Corticobulbar - Control movement of the head/face (cobulbar)

The more complex or delicate the movement is, the more neurons are involved in signaling movement to the muscles involved.

## Prefrontal Cortex
The prefrontal cortex receives input from all parts of the cerebral cortex. It helps us decide when, why, and how we do things.
* Houses 14-17% of the neurons in the brain
* Has both inhibitory and excitatory connections, acting as on/off switches for "if, then" decisions
* Makes information based on several different sources of information
* One of the last regions to undergo [[03-Neurons and Glials#Myelin|myelination]], contributing to high impulsiveness and lack of consideration of context in adolescents

Some sections are further specialized to on specific criteria or inputs:
* **Ventromedial prefrontal cortex** - Helps modulate behavior based on fear
* **Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex** - Helps maintain information in working memory, changing how we do things depending on current tasks

Dysfunction in this area correlates with *negative symptoms* in schizophrenic patients, including social withdrawal.

## Frontal Lobotomies
A controversial psychosurgery, where an ice pick is inserted into the frontal cortex and moved around. This surgery led to most of what we know about the frontal lobes, since we can observe what patients were unable to now do. Effects include:
* Slowing of thoughts and loss of spontaneity
* In the [[14.3-Words and Objects#Wisconsin Card Sorting Task|Wisconsin card sorting task]], once patients found a pattern that matches, they would stick to that pattern, even if the researcher tells them they are wrong
* Loss of self-awareness and flat affect, especially empathy
* Deficiencies in foresight and planning
* Tendency to confabulate (very bad lying). Lying involves thinking back on what you said, as well as predicting what the other person's reaction would be.
