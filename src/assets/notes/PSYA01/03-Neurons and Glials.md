# Neurons and Glials
The nervous system is the main interpreter of both events in your body and the outside world. It consists of an integrated set of networks composed of neurons (cells that transmit electrical impulses) and glial cells (provides support functions). 

## Neurons
Neurons are the building blocks of the nervous system. Neurons communicate with each other through electrical impulses and release chemicals that alter the electrical activity of other neurons. They have a limited ability to regenerate, and we lose more than we gain as we grow. Neurons can change in response to their environment through **neuroplasticity**, which is the ability of neurons and their networks to change.

They have a cell body, nucleus, and internal machinery similar to other cells. However, they have specialized structures that make them unique to others:
* **Nucleus** - Membrane-bound structure found in the soma of the neuron. Contains the nucleolus and chromosomes, necessary for the codec production of proteins within the cell
* **Soma** - The cell body of the neuron
* **Dendrite** - Extensions of the cell body membrane that branch out to communicate with other neurons. Receives messages from other neurons.
* **Axon Hillock** - Intersection between the soma and the axon
* **Axon** - Delivers messages to other neurons and body parts
* **Axon Terminal** - Once the action potential gets too the axon terminal, triggers the release of the neurotransmitter

## Dendrites
Dendrites extend from the cell body membrane, and branch out to connect with the axon terminals of other neurons. These connections spread out to more neurons as we grow and learn.

## Soma
The action of the cell depends on the sum of inputs received from dendrites. If this results in the cell "firing", an electrical impulse called an **action potential** passes through the soma and leaves the cell body at the axon hillock (beginning of the axon). 

## Axon
The axon receives the action potential at the **axon hillock**, which is the connection between the soma and the axon. The action potential is transmitted down the axon terminal, to the **terminal buttons**.

> Axon's are similar to Iron Man's arms, where the beams of light are neurotransmitters that cause electrical impulses in, or disable, their targets.

## Myelin
The axon also has a protein and fatty substance called **myelin**, that keeps the electrical impulse flowing down the axon. There are breaks in the myelin, called the **nodes of Ranvier**, where channels are exposed to allow ions to flow into and out of the axon, speeding up the process.

In the process of **myelination**, oligodendrocytes wrap myelin around axons.

## Action Potential
Our bodies contain positively and negatively charged particles. These include:
* Sodium - Positively charged
* Potassium - Positively charged
* Chloride - Negatively charged

These ions can enter or exit the cell through voltage-gated channels. 

The neuron can be in three different states:
* **Polarized** - Large number of negatively charged ions, resulting in a negative charge, usually around -70 millivolts (mV). Neuron is at rest, no neurotransmitters are released.
* **Depolarized** - Large number of positively charged particles move inside the cell.
* **Neutral** - Cell is neutrally charged, at about 0 millivolts.

> **Polarized** - Neuron is at rest, no neurotransmitters are released
> **Depolarization** - Large inflow of positively charged ions (Na+)
> **Action Potential** - Neuron activates and sends a neurotransmitter to message other neurons or organs
> **Repolarization** - Large outflow of positively charged ions (K+)

Multiple Na+ channels are lined up along the axon, causing the electrical impulse to continue in succession along the axon. As gated channels in each successive section sense the positive shift in voltage, they pop open too, repeating the rush of Na+, called **propagation**.

When the action potential reaches the axon terminal, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters.

Neurons do not want to be fully active all the time, so it has to return to its resting potential. This is done through the opening of K+ channels, causing Na+ to rush out. This results in quick repolarization of the neuron to negative resting potential.

## Neurotransmitters
Neurotransmitters are the chemicals released from axon terminals. There are over 100 different types of neurotransmitters in the body, which play vital roles in mood.

Neurotransmitters can be:
* **Excitatory** - Increases the probability of the neuron becoming electrically active
* **Inhibitory** - Decreases the probability that the neuron is activated
Neurons can receive inputs from both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters.

After exiting vesicles in the axon of the first neuron (presynaptic), the neurotransmitters enter the synaptic space (area between the axon and the dendrite), and become attracted to the receptors on the second neuron (postsynaptic).

Receptors act like locked-doors, with specially shaped binding sites for specific types of neurotransmitter.

## Glial Cells
Glial cells support neurons and outnumbers them ten to one. They perform vital roles, including:
* Providing structural support for neurons
* Bringing nutrients
* Removing waste and dead neuron
* Speeding up electrical impulses

**Oligodendrocytes** are glial cells that are responsible for wrapping myelin around the axons of some neurons in the brain and spinal cord.

**Schwann cells** do the same as oligodendrocytes, but for nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord.

**Astrocytes** help get nutrition to the neurons, to maintain the balance of charged particles inside and outside the neurons.

**Microglia** help to clean debris that could lead to dangerous inflammation in the brain.
