# Language and Thought
Language is the grouping of spoken, written, or gestured symbols to convey information. Humans are about to demonstrate **productivity**, allowing us to produce new messages by connecting unrelated information.

All animals mostly use their bodies and sounds to communicate. They learn through direct observation, but usually in the here and now.

Human language is different, in that it allows us to transport knowledge and ideas across space and time. The three keys that lead to our domination of the planet are:
1. Bipedalism - Freeing up our hands
2. Frontal cortex - Figures out useful ways to use our hands
3. Language - Transmit knowledge across generations

Animals have strong **receptive language** abilities, and are able to make connections between objects and labels (i.e. dog and the name of their toys). However, this could just be good conditioning, they may not know the meaning.

Scientists are looking for organisms that can use language in a flexible way, where words are symbols and are used to represent and convey ideas, the so-called **abstract symbol system**.

Words can have different meanings in different contexts:
> Joe took a bite out of his burger
> Joe's burger took a bite out of his wallet

Many different words can have similar meanings:
> Steve likes music
> Steve enjoys music
> Music is one of Steve's hobbies
> Music is Steve's favourite things
> Steve thinks music is fantastic

## Spatial Location Experiment
A study that demonstrates the ability to produce new information through language. For each of the four situations shown, we perform the following:
1. Subject searches for a hidden reward.
2. Subject is blindfolded and spun around.
3. Subject must find the hidden reward again.

> A - Rats searching for reward in an open, rectangular arena without cues
> B - Rats searching for reward in an open, rectangular arena with corners distinguished by smells
> C - 18-month child searching for reward in an open, rectangular arena without cues
> D - 18-month child searching for reward in an open, rectangular arena with back wall painted blue

Without making each corner unique, the subject searches two of the corners based on the rectangular nature of the arena. However, if the corners are made distinct with the help of search cues, we should be distinguish between the two corners to find the reward.

Both the rat and 18-month child don't use their respective cues, and still search the two corners based on the rectangular room. Neither the rat or child are unintelligent, since they remember where the reward was hidden before.

However, children are less capable of creating representations or fully link one thing (blue wall) to another (reward corner).

## Language and Consciousness
We may assume that language and consciousness developed together. However, animals may have rich conscious experiences without language.

Suppose a deer brings their fawn to a pool of water, where a predator is hiding. The fawn gets eaten, and the deer runs away.

The deer may replay the event whenever they go near a pool of water. However, they don't have the ability to convey that experience to other deers. Language may have developed after consciousness, in order to share our consciousness with others.

## Realtime Interactions
For our mental health, its importal to have realtime interactions. Through text messages, we only get a delayed reaction, with emojis trying to express emotion that the frontal lobe chooses.

We miss the nonverbal grunts, sighs, snickers, and laughs that convey the emotion of the message and is sometimes more important than the message itself.

## Needing to be Heard
When we are engaging in an argument, both sides want to make a point that they want the other side to hear. Both sides talk, nobody listens, and things spiral.

If you stop talking and clearly listen, things will calm. Let the person know they were heard by repeating what they said, showing understanding if possible. Then ask the other to listen and give your perspective in a calm, rational way.
