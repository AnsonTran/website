# Learning
Learning is defined as a relatively permanent change in behavior not due to drugs (the first administration), maturation/development, injury, or disease. Events in the world around use affect **behavior**, and behavior produces effects on the environment.

**Innate** skills are skills that are not the result of learning. Once started, these behaviors cannot be stopped, even if we know its coming. The knee-jerk reflex is a good example of this.

**Reflexes** involve situations that naturally produce a corresponding behavior. They apply to a relatively small proportion of our behavior, but can be conditioned to other cues.

## Persuasion
When we're trying to persuade someone of something, there are two routes we can take:
* **Central route of persuasion** - The audience is highly motivated, and willing to listen to the arguments being made by the speaker. This often leads to lasting change, and would include lectures and TED talks
* **Peripheral route of persuasion** - The audience does not want to see the message, and so there are peripheral cues that can be shown to influence their decision making. Advertisements are a clear example.

## Biological Constraints
Some stimuli are more likely than others to become signals for important events, a concept called **biological preparedness**. For example, it's easier to condition a Pavlovian fear to snakes and spiders than arbitrary stimuli such as flowers and tones.

Phobias are different from fear conditioning in the laboratory because they:
* Can be learned in a single trial
* Persist even when we know the feared object is harmless
* Are things that could harm our ancestors that we probably won't encounter
* Do not extinguish quickly or easily

In a laboratory setting, its difficult to assotiate a *shock* with *snakes and spiders*, since these creatures do not belong with shock. We associate snakes and spiders more closely with nausea.
