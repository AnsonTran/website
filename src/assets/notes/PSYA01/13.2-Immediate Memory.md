# Immediate Memory
Immediate memory actively holds information at the front of your mind.

## Representation
The kind of information a memory system contains. Often described in terms of how the information is represented or "coded":
* **Inner voice** - Immediate memory represented verbally. For example, when counting up to 10 in your head.
* **Inner eye** - Immediate memory represented visually. For example, imagining yourself walking through your house to count windows.

> It takes longer to answer questions about the goose, if the first image is in your inner eye, since you have to mentally *zoom in* to the image

## Duration
How long information can stay in your immediate memory before it is forgotten. Information can stay forever, but you have to engage in **rehearsal**, repeating information to yourself in order to rehear the information over and over.

> If rehearsal is interrupted, information is easily lost in the immediate memory. In this study, participants must remember three consonants (CWN, for example), and were prevented from rehearsal by counting backwards from a large number by three (364,361,358,355, etc.).

## Capacity
How much information can fit into a single instance of rehearsal before contents begin to break down. *Seven plus or minus two*, is the standard answer for the average person's **memory span** (how many items can be kept active in the mind at one time). 

The time that it takes to rehearse information can also affect capacity. Capacity of immediate memory is whatever can be rehearsed in roughly two seconds, rather than the number of items.

Items can be chunked to make it easier to remember.

## Working Memory Model
Argues that immediate memory is not simply a place for storage of information, but primarily for the manipulation of memory. Consists of the following components:
1. **Phonological Loop** - Manifestation of the inner voice. Auditory and verbal information is temporarily stored and manipulated.
2. **Visuospatial Sketchpad** - Manifestation of the inner eye. Visual and spatial information is temporarily stored and manipulated.
3. **Central Executive** - Directs the flow of information to and from the phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, and long-term memory.
