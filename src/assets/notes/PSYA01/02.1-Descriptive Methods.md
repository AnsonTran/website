# Descriptive Methods
Any means to capture, report, record, or describe a group. Identifies *what is*, without necessarily understanding *why it is*.

## Naturalistic Observation
Observation of behavior as it happens in a natural environment, without attempting to manipulate or control the conditions of the observation. Disadvantages of this approach include:
* Researchers lack control over the environment
* Perspective and bias of the researcher can influence the interpretation of behaviors they find relevant

## Participant Observation
The researcher becomes part of the group under investigation. Being part of the group provides a more enriching experience and grants access to the daily life and activities of group members. Disadvantages are:
* Immersion of the observer increases reactivity. Their presence can change behavior
* As more time is spent in the group, they are biased to see only things that fit the initial hypothesis
* Researchers can become involved and sympathetic to the group, interfering with research objectivity

## Case Study
In-depth analysis of a unique circumstance or individual. We observe an unusual patient and attempt to investigate the patient's condition in more detail to provide a broader understanding of a phenomenon. Challenges of case studies include:
* Difficulty generalizing findings from a unique case
* Likely not capturing a representation of an entire population of people

## Surveys
An efficient way to quickly collect information and gather an understanding of the current state of people's opinions or attitutes. Administered through 
* Online surveys
* Mailed questionnaires
* Person-to-person interviews
* Phone interviews.

Instead of asking every member of a group, we can survey a smaller sample. 

Surveys can suffer from various issues with bias:
* **Sampling bias** - Sample selected has to be representative of the broader population
* **Wording effect** - Questions must be carefully worded to avoid biasing the outcome positively or negatively
* **Response bias** - Participants can answer the way they feel they are expected to
* **Acquiescent response bias** - Tendency to say *yes* to all items regardless of their own opinion
* **Socially desirable bias** - Respond in ways seen to be acceptable by others
* **Illusory superiority** - Tendency to describe our own behavior as better than average
* **Volunteer bias** - Only a motivated fraction of the population would respond to the survey or participate in research

## Correlation
Relationship that shows that as one variable changes, so does another. Can be described by the direction and strength of the relationship between variables.

A problem with correlation is differentiating *correlations* from *causation*. Two variables may be correlated, but there may be a **confounding variable** that affects both of them. 

### Direction of correlation
How a change in one variable affects the other variable:
* **Positively correlated** - The two variables change in the same direction.
* **Negatively correlated** - Increase in one variable leads to a decrease in the other
* **Zero correlation** - No apparent relationship between variables

### Strength of Correlation
Strength of the correlation can be measured with a **correlation coefficient** that ranges from -1 to +1. The sign of the value determines the direction.

Correlations get stronger as they get closer to -1 or +1. Stronger relationships have data points that cluster around the line of best fit.
