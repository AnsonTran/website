# Brain on Drugs
The interaction between neurotransmitters and receptors can be artificially manipulated or affected in many ways through chemicals. Drugs can have different effects depending on the location of the receptor.
* **Agonists** - Mimics the action of endogenous (naturally produced by the body) neurotransmitter
* **Antagonists** - Prevents the action of endogenous neurotransmitters.
* **Partial agonists/antagonists** - Binds to and activates the receptor with less "power" than endogenous neurotransmitters.

Additionally, these drugs can be:
* **Competitive** - Compete with neurotransmitters for the same binding site on the receptor
* **Non-competitive** - Don't compete, since they bind at a different site. These chemicals are called passive-aggressive, since they don't directly confront the neurotransmitter, but instead interfere with receptor function from some hidden location.

|Neurotransmitter|Excitatory/Inhibitory|Function|Associated Drugs|
|---|---|---|---|
| Glutamate|Excitatory|Learning and movement|PCP (causes hallucinations), Ketamine (anesthetic)|
|GABA|Inhibitory|Learning, anxiety regulation through inhibition of neurons|Valium (used to treat anxiety), Flumazenil (used to reverse anesthesia)
|Acetylcholine|Excitatory|Learning, muscle action|Botox (Botulinum toxin, inhibits release of acetylcholine)|
|Dopamine|Excitatory/ Inhibitory|Learning, Reward/Pleasure|Cocaine (prevents reuptake of dopamine, produces euphoria)
|Serotonin|Excitatory/Inhibitory|Elevation / depression of mood|Prozac (prevents reuptake of serotonin, used to treat depression)|
|Norepinephrine|Excitatory/Inhibitory|Elevation / depression of mood|Doxepin (used for treating anxiety and depression)|
|Enkaphalins/Endorphins|Excitatory|Regulation of pain responses|Opiates (Morphine, Heroin)|

## Addiction
Addiction involves an increased ability to tolerate a drug, with larger and larger doses required to achieve the same physical and psychological effects. The brain has adapted to the presence of the chemical, and consumption is met with responses by the body.

At later stages, **dependence** occurs, where there is a physical or psychological need for the drug to maintain normal functioning.

Once dependence is achieved, **withdrawal** occurs in the absence of the drug. Symptoms include headaches, shaking, vomiting, or changes in mood.

## Depressants
Depressants slow or depress arousal of the central nervous system.

### Alcohol
A commonly used depressant is **alcohol**, which is often abused due to its availability.
* In low doses, it creates sensations of relaxation or drowsiness, improved mood, and increased self-confidence. 
* As consumption increases, people experience impaired judgement, slowed reaction times, and uncoordinated motor movements
* In large doses, people experience alcohol poisoning, where the effects on the central nervous system cause extreme disorientation and irregular heartbeating and breathing.

Alcohol has the following effects on neurotransmitters:
* Inhibits the effectiveness of glutamine, especially in the hippocampus-an area associated with learning and memory.
* Increases the effectiveness of GABA, one of the main neurotransmitters implicated in relaxed states. 
* Increases the dopaminergic system.

### Barbiturates and Benzodiazepines
**Barbiturates** are depressants used to treat a variety of psychological disorders:
* Anxiety
* Obsessive-compulsive disorder
* Epilepsy
* 
They create a sense of relaxation, acting on the amount of GABA in the brain. In large doses, concentration becomes difficult, and speech becomes slurred. Barbiturates can be addictive and fatal, so **benzodiazepines** are more frequently prescribed.

## Stimulants
Stimulants increase the activity of the nervous system. Common stimulants include:
* Caffeine
* Nicotine
* Cocaine
* Amphetamines

### Caffeine
Caffeine is the msot widely used psychoactive drug in the world. In low doses, people experience increased energy, creativity, and ability to focus on work. It blocks adenosine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

### Nicotine
Highly addictive stimulant, found in cigarettes. It stimulates the release of **acetylcholine**, an excitatory neurotransmitter, and other neurotransmitters in the brain. Studies on nonhuman models indicate long-term nicotine use:
* Reduces overall levels of acetylcholine in the brain
* Increases activity of dopaminergic neurons, causing release of dopamine

Smoking nicotine decreases the amount of time between ingestion and its effects, which increases likelihood of addiction.

### Cocaine and Amphetamines
Both have similar effects, but differ in their sites of action:
* Enhancing the effects of dopamine
* Combat the effects of hunger and fatigue
* Create a subjective sensation of grandeur/euphoria, and a heightened sense of alertness.

Cocaine binds to and deactivates proteins that aids in the reuptake of dopamine, prolonging its effects.

Amphetamines also inhibit reuptake of dopamine, but also stimulate release of dopamine from the terminal buttons.

In both cases, chronic use leads to:
* Impairment in the way dopamine operates in the brain
* Hallucinations, delusions of paranoia, psychotic behavior

## Hallucinogens
Also called psychedelic drugs, hallucinogens directly influence the sensory systems and interpretation of reality, distorting our sense of time and space. A common symptom is **synesthesia**, where the senses seem to blend. Listening to music may create the experience of seeing colors or tactile sensations.

### Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD)
A synthetic drug that causes altered emotions and a sense of being in a "waking dream". Symptoms include:
* Vivid sensory hallucinations
* Alterations in perceptions of time and space
* Blurring of perceptions between the senses

The drug acts as an agonist of serotonin, specifically serotonin receptors in the thalamus. 

### Mescaline
Derived from the peyote cactus, and comonly used in religious ceremonies in Native American culture. Effects are similar to LSD, with some unique ones:
* Color perception feels enhanced
* Repeating patterns appear in the visual field
* Numbness, tension, anxiety, and intense nausea

### Cannabis
Most commonly used hallucinogen, with diffuse effects on the nervous system. Effects include:
* Increase in appetite
* Feelings of euphoria
* Relaxation, and even paranoia

Some specific regions of the brain have been found to respond to THC, which include:
* Cerebellum
* Hippocampus
* Basal ganglia
* Cerebral cortex

The receptors do not act directly with the brain, but influence how other neurotransmitters are released. Cannabis receptors inhibit many neurotransmitters, including:
* Norepinephrine
* Acetylcholine
* Glutamate
* GABA
