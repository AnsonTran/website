# Parietal Lobes
Heavily involved in processing numbers and performing calculations. It processes information about where the body is in space and forms mental representations of numbers. Damage to the parietal lobes on the:
* Right side - Causes problems navigating the space around us (spacial relations)
* Left side - Causes us to misinterpret sensations

## Primary Sensory Cortex
Each side of the sensory cortex receives input from the opposite (contralateral) side of the body. The nerves that carry sensation from the body, and motor commands from the brain to the body cross at the brainstem.

The crossing (decussation) of nerves allows:
* Information carried from the sensory receptors to integrate with other areas of the brain via circuits in the brainstem and the thalamus
* Coordination between both sides of the body to reach across the midline of the body

## Sensory Association Cortex
The association cortex seems to be involed in complex spatial functions, and differs across the hemispheres.

### Left Sensory Association Cortex
Keeps track of the spatial location of our body, a process called **proprioception**. Often when you wake up after sleeping on your hand and all the blood has drained out of it, you lose proprioception of that hand. Damage to this area is often associated with poor motor movements.

> A woman who had damage to this region woke up in the middle of the night, and found a human leg in her bed, and threw it off.

### Right Sensory Association Cortex
Keeps track of the spatial location of things in our external world. Damage can lead to problems of neglect and spatial integration of parts.

> Patients asked to draw a clock would only draw up to 6, and then stop.

> When eating a plate of food, patients would only eat food on the right side, even if they are able to see the left side of the plate. Only when you rotate the plate, would they eat the rest of the food.
