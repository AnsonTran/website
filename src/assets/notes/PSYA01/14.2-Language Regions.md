# Language Regions
Many places in the brain are responsible for different components of language. The two main areas attributed to language processing are:
1. Broca's area
2. Wernicke's area

## Broca's Area
Discovered after a man who had been kicked by a horse was treated by Dr. Paul Broca. The patient had difficulty producing speech, and was only able to utter *tan*, a condition known as **aphasia**. The patient had damage to the lower frontal lobe, with no damage to muscles controlling facial movements.

DIfficulty producing words, is referred to as **Broca's aphasia**, or **non-fluent aphasia**.

Broca's findings led to many important discoveries:
1. There may be a module in the brain controlling speech
2. Language production is predominantly controlled by the left hemisphere
3. Birds are unable to produce recognizable birdsong if their left lobe is damaged
4. Primates possess the anatomy to produce human speech, but their Broca's area have not developed in a similar mannar to humans
5. Other non-human animals have not developed a version of a gene called **FOXP2**. Manipulating this gene in mice leads to improved [[14-Language and Thought#Cheng 1986|language tasks]]

Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot in the left hemisphere of her brain, giving her Broca's aphasia. Since music exists in both sides of the brain, therapists used music to help develop a language region on the right side of the brain.

## Wernicke's Area
Dr. Carl Wernicke had a patient whom was able to produce speech fluidly, but the speech produced was not coherent, and they had difficulty with language comprehension. The patient had damage to the temporal lobe, where Wernicke's area resides.

Intact physical production of words, but lack of meaning in communication, is referred to as **Wernicke's aphasia**, or **fluent aphasia**. The **prosody** (melody) of speech patterns is intact, but the ability to convey meaning is damaged.

## Early Models
Early models of language believed that:
1. Auditory information is first processed by the auditory cortex
2. Sent to Wernicke's area to be processed for meaning
3. Wernicke's area organizes your intended speech and projects that to Broca's area
4. Broca's area is responsible for motor output and production
