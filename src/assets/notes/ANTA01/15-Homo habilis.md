# Homo habilis
Before the [[14-Earliest Hominins#Lomekwian Tool Culture|Lomekwian ]] stone tools were found or uncovered, we assumed that *Homo habilis* was the first tool maker (habilis means handyman), dated to around 2.8-1.6 million years ago. These fossils extend from Ethiopia to Southern Africa. Its features include:
* Less prognathic face
* Larger brain, with an average of 631 cc
* Smaller post-canine teeth (premolars and molars)
* More vertical forehead

Studies into the bones and teeth found that its phalanges and finger bones were similar to ours, capable of a *precision grip*. This grip would have been necessary to make and create the tools it was found with. Researchers concluded that *Homo habilis* was a transition species between the earlier Australopiths and later members of the Genus *Homo*. 

## Oldowan Tool Culture
The Oldowan tools are associated with *Homo habilis*, and were found at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania.

These choppers are essentially a bunch of rocks banged around with other rocks. Also called *pebble tools*, because they began as rounded pebbles.

Oldowan tools were created using a technique called hard hammer percussion. A rounded core is struck with a hammerstone on the striking platform, creating a flake. They improve on the previous techniques, in that they require planning and decision making as to the angle at which the core is struck, in order to create a core with sharp edges.

Tools were used for butchering meat, as evidenced by the cut-mark found in a horse ankle bone found in the same strata as the *Homo habilis* skeletons. It's likely that *Homo habilis* were scavengers, since they are still small-bodied.

## Homo rudolfensis
A specimen found 15 or so years after *Homo habilis*. The remains were extremely fragmented, and had to be reconstructed bit by bit. It has
* A very large brain compared to *Homo habilis*
* Even taller forehead
* Flatter, less prognathic face

Debate is ongoing whether *Homo rudolfensis* should be designated its own species, or whether it is just variation among *Homo habilis*.

Taking into account other specimens that were found around the same time, there is a good amount of variation among them. Another possibility is sexual dimorphism, where we have a male specimen and a female specimen.
