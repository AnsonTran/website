# Excavation
Before we can excavate, we need to look for **archaeological sites** where there is the potential for past human activity. If we're working in a CRM role (cultural resource management), an archaeological site could be where a skyscraper is being built.

The process of discovering the location of archaeological sites is through a **site survey**. We would walk in straight lines through an area, looking for artifacts. If we find something noteworthy, we would leave a flag down to take note of it. Information collected could also be used for **landscape archaeology**.

The presence or absence of sites could provide context as well, as sites are usually close to water sources, shelters, low-lying areas, etc.

## Context
In the process of excavating a site, there is one guiding principle that archaeologists always need to remember
$$\text{All excavation is descruction}$$
As we are digging, we are destroying the **context** (spatial and temporal assocations) of artifacts and features found in the archaeological site.

Context provides most of the important archaeological information, and has lost much of its value without it.

The goal of excavation is to retain as much information about the context as possible. We need to preserve information on its location in both the **vertical** and **horizontal** dimensions. In addition, a record of the site's **geology** needs to be preserved before excavation

## Box-Grid Excavation
Box-Grid excavation emphasizes the horizontal dimension by exposing large areas of a layer/level to reveal the spatial relationships (associations) between artifacts and features in that layer/level.

If we were trying to excavate a large continuous structure such as a Roman mosaic floor, the box-grid method could get in the way of tracing the entire structure and letting you view it.

## Stratigraphical Column
Rather than excavating units separated by bulks, the site is divided into a series of $1$ metre squared columns. Columns are excavated individually, and items are positioned relative to the corners using GPS points.

Stratigraphical excavation emphasizes the vertical dimension by cutting into deep deposits to reveal stratification. The walls are left intact with the original geology, and layers of sediment.

> Excavation is not always entirely horizontal as in the box-grid method. We may choose to dig down by stratigraphical layers.

After finding any artifacts or fossils, we don't immediately remove it. Instead, we dig around it as we go so that we can find where the bottom of the artifact extends. That would indicate the stratigraphic layer where the artifact is laid down.
