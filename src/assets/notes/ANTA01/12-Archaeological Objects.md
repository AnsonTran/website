## Evolutionary Anthropologists
Evolutionary anthropologists study humans and human ancestors by looking at their skeletons. Bones are living tissue, that undergo changes over the course of our lives, as we're exposed to different outside sources and environmental conditions.

Osteologists study bones, and can extract a lot of information from the skeleton:
* Age
* Biological sex
* Health status
* Appearance
* Some aspects of behaviour
