# Peopleing of America
During the upper paleolithic, we see an increase in the geographical range of modern humans. We see our extension to further extremes of the globe than we've seen earlier, reaching virtually all corners of the globe. 

## Clovis First Hypothesis (Outdated)
The Clovis first hypothesis for the peopleing of North America makes several claims that turns out to be incorrect:
* The earliest people came to North America about 13,200 years ago
* Came from Asia, crossing the Bering land bridge (Beringia)
* Tool culture is typified by Clovis points
* Were accomplished hunters of megafauna (mastodons, mammoths, etc.) which led to the extinction of some species ("overkill" hypothesis).

During low sea levels during glacial time periods, a land mass forms a continuous bridge, called the Bering land bridge, from Asia and Alaska. Sea levels dropped about 100 metres intermittently, with a continuous ice age between 25,000 and 11,000 years ago.

The **overkill hypothesis** suggests Clovis people moved south from the Bering land bridge, driving megafauna to extinction along their route.

## Clovis Tool Industry
The clovis industry, were used to kill off the megafauna. It has long thin blades taken off cores, and is characterized by **fluting** (indentation at the bottom of the blade), to create a more firmly attached tool when hafted to a shaft.

> Clovis points between 13,200 and 12,800 years ago. Named for a site in New Mexico.

## Monte Verde
A problem with the Clovis first hypothesis, is the presence of archaeological sites that predate 13,200 years ago, that do not include Clovis technology.

> A site in Monte Verde Chile, between 18,500-14,500 years ago. This is located more than 16,000 kilometers away from the Bering land bridge. Very well preserved, with wooden housing foundations.

The tools found here are very different from the Clovis technology. Instead, we have an earlier type of tool technology.

## Meadowcroft Rock Shelter
Moving north to Pennsylvania, this site is a location of multiple human occupations between 19,000 and 14,000 years ago.

Tools are not as finely made as the Clovis, and they do not have the distinctive "fluting" that are characteristic of Clovis tools.

## White Sands National Park
From White Sands National Park in south-central New Mexico, we find footprints between 23,000 and 21,000 years ago. Many of the footprints appear to be those of teenages and children, suggesting the division of labour.

These footprints appear in the same stratographic layers as mammoth footprints, suggesting an overlap of humans and megafauna for about 2,000 years during the site occupation. Although people here are accomplished hunters, it does not support the overkill hypothesis.

## Chiquihuite Cave
A site in Chiquihuite Cave, Mexico stretches the evidence of people in the Americas back to 33,000 years ago. It is located 9,000 feet above sea level, and is likely first occupied between 33,000 and 31,000 years ago.

Human DNA was not found at the site, but about 1,900 stone tools were found. They are small and finely made, but not typical of Clovis tools.

## Pacific Coastal Route Hypothesis
Sites have been found that predate the Clovis 13,200 years ago. However, the ice-free corridor was closed before 13,700 years ago, which is problematic for a route through Beringia. This suggests that early humans may have used a different route from Asia to get to the Americas.

The Pacifical coastal route hypothesis suggests that humans followed a coastal route with boats, hugging the shoreline to reach the Americas. During the glacial periods, the coastline would have been lower than it is today.

## Kennewick Man
Kennewick Man is about 9,200 years old, and found in Washington State. The initial study found that his bones did not appear similar to Asians or modern first nations people. People believed that he was a white person.

In 2015, genetic results from Kennewick man shows that he is more closely related to modern Indigenous peoples in the area where he was found. He has since been repatriated and reburied.
