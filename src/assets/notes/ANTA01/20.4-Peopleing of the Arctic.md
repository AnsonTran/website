# Peopleing of the Artic
The Arctic is the last frontier where humans went to live in prehistoric times. While early migrations into the Americas had to deal with fairly inhospitable conditions, the most inhospitable areas were not inhabited until later. The arctic was not inhabited continuously until about 4,500 years ago. 

They had to adapt very sophisticated cultural practices to survive and thrive in the Arcitc.

## Arctic Small Tool Tradition
The Arctic tools were very small, finely worked implements mounted to the tips of harpoons or spears made of bone, antler, or ivory. This type of tool spread incredibly quickly, from Alaska all the way to Greenland within 500 years. It maximizes the goal of making the most of what you have.
