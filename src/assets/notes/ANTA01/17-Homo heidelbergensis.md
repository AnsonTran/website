# Homo heidelbergensis
Around 640,000 to 120,000 years ago, we start to see hominins with features that appear more modern. In general they are more advanced than *Homo erectus*, but not yet modern. These specimens don't have any characteristics that are unique to them, rather they exhibit a mosaic of modern human and *Homo erectus* traits. 

Specimen are called *Homo heidelbergensis* if they retain some of the features of *Homo erectus*, such as:
* Supraorbital torus
* Nuchal torus
* Sagittal crest
* Slow, sloping forehead
* Thick cranial bones
* Brain size

> *Homo erectus* primitive traits

In addition, they must also possess one or more traits that are distinctively modern human, such as:
* Smaller brow ridges
* No nuchal torus
* No sagittal keel
* Vertical forehead
* Fully modern brain size

Each specimen has its own mosaic of features, including modern features and *Homo erectus* traits. By definition, this species is intermediate, and likely includes representatives of the lineages that bridge the gap between *Homo erectus*, *Homo sapiens*, and *Homo neanderthalensis*.

Specimen that show this mosaic of features are found in Europe, Africa, and Asia, and their range corresponds to the distribution of *Homo erectus*. However, we get a much more extensive fossil record in Europe than for *Homo erectus*.

## Bodo
Oldest specimens of *Homo heidelbergensis* are from Africa. This specimen was found from the site of Bodo, Ethiopia, and dated to around 640,000 years ago. Its features include:
* Slight sagittal keel
* Massive supraorbital ridges
* Low cranial vault with receding forehead
* Large cranial capacity of about 1300 cc, well within modern human range

This specimen has clear evidence of defleshing post-mortem, as shown from the tool marks used on the zygomatic bone.

Bodo was likely part of a secondary burial, an early human cultural practice, where humans are buried for some time, dug up, cleaned of remaining soft tissue, and then buried again. The lack of meat around the zygomatic arch supports the idea of secondary burial, rather than cannibalism.

## Arago Cave
A site in Arago Cave, France, dated to about 450,000 years ago. The best known specimen is a cranium referred as Arago-21. It features include:
* Very large brow ridges
* Fairly low cranial capacity

![[Pasted image 20220817183459.png]]

The specimen was found on a garbage pile, among ancient food remains that were found in the cave.

## Steinheim
A skull found in a site in Steinheim, Germany, dated to about 250,000 years ago. Its features include:
* Massive brow ridges
* Sloping forehead
* Thin cranial bone (no sagittal keel)
* No nuchal torus
* Widest point of the skull is located up high
* Cranial capacity is around 1140 cc, near the high end of *Homo erectus*, but low end of modern humans

## Atapuerca Sima de los Huesos
This site called Atapuerca Sima de los Huesos (*translates* - pit of bones), in Spain has possibly the largest collection of *Homo heidelbergensis* material in the world. The site is dated to around 430,000 years ago, and produced about 80% of all the middle Pleistocene hominin remains, with over 4000 pieces recovered, representing at least 32 different individuals.

The site likely represents evidence for funeral practice, since this huge concentration of hominin remains likely wont have formed without other hominins putting them there.

To get to the pit, we must travel through over a mile of underground passages. The remains are concentrated into one area, at the bottom of a 12 metre deep vertical shaft.

Specimens from this site, such as Atapuerca 5 show primitive *Homo erectus* like features, but also some Neanderthal-like traits:
* Mid-facial prognathism (noise seems pulled forward relative to the rest of the skull)
* Strongly arched brow ridges, like a neanderthal

## Jinniushan
A cranium found in China, dated to about 200,000 years old. It is a fairly typical *Homo heidelbergensis* specimen, with a mixture of *Homo erectus* features and modern traits. Its features include:
* Large brow ridges
* Thin cranial bone

However, unlike the specimens from Europe and Africa, it foreshadows some characteristic features of modern Asian populations, including:
* Broad nasal bridge
* Prominent cheek bones
* Shovel-shaped incisors

![[Pasted image 20220817185430.png]]

Shovel-shaped incisors are a characteristically Asian feature, with the hollowing out of the inner surface of the upper incisors. Suggests a direct evolutionary relationship between these early forms and modern humans from Asia.

## Levallois Technique
Around 200,000 years ago, some populations of *Homo heidelbergensis* began using the Levallois technique. This is seen as a significant advance over previous techniques, since there is a significant amount of control over how the flake is knocked of the core. 

![[Pasted image 20220817190022.png]]
> In the preparation stage, a relatively large core is flaked along the sides and top.

![[Pasted image 20220817190145.png]]
> A chunk from the back of the core is removed, making a striking platform.

![[Pasted image 20220817190338.png]]
> The core is struck on the striking platform that was prepared in previous steps, removing a flake

![[Pasted image 20220817190811.png]]
> The core can be re-shaped, allowing the removal of another flake, and to continue the process.

A typical Lavallois core can be used to produce four or five flakes, depending on the size of the core. Each flake can be refined further, in order to specialize it for different tasks.

## Schoeningen Wooden Spears
Here, we get the first evidence of hunting behavior in *Homo heidelbergensis*. Wooden spears were found in a cave in Germany, dated reliably about 400,000 years ago. The spears were deposited in an oxygen-free environment, and so weren't broken down by microbes.
* Each spear was made from an individual trunk, from an approximately 30 year old Spruce tree.
* Fashioned from the end closest to the base of the tree, where the wood is most dense, indicating that the makers were familiar with the properties of the trees raw materials.
* Had the same proportions, and were well balanced for throwing, with the center of gravity about a third of the way down the shaft from the sharp end.
* 3-5 cm grooves cut in the end of the tools, which may have held a tool or flake

Stone tools and faunal remains were also found, including elephants, bears, rhinos, red deer, and horses, with cut marks consistent with butchery.

## Boxgrove
From a site in Boxgrove, England, dated to about 500,000 years ago, we find bones that exhibit cut marks. Further suggests that *Homo heidelbergensis* at least did some hunting.
