# Civilization Theories
Bias in thinking of civilizations as being superior to others who did not meet all the 7 requirements of a civilization often meant that early debates about why civilizations arose led to racist and outdated theories.

## Unilinear Evolution Model (Incorrect)
Lewis Henry Morgan, had the notion of a unilinear evolution of human society. He thought that human cultures passed through a set series of levels, based on their technological and intellectual abilities. These levels passed through the following stages:
1. Savagery
2. Barbarism - Marked by the production of pottery
3. Civilization - Marked by the alphabet and writing

This model is incorrect, and is problematic:
* Does not explain the relevance of the acquisition of most technological/cultural advancement.
* Assumes that some forms of human societies are on top of others, which is inherently racist.
* Obscures variability, and fails to predict what we might expect archaeologically (not everyone used pottery, even if they had access to it)
* Neglects and reflects cultural institutions that perpetuate inequality (you must have this alphabet and formal writing)

## Joseph Tainter's Taxonomy
Participating in societies came at a cost, especially for the participants. They were required to:
* Pay taxes to some leader
* Offer their blood, sweat, and tears to perform jobs for the state

It is difficult to figure out whether people voluntarily participated in societies, or if they didn't have a choice at all.

Joseph Tainter suggested that hypotheses about the origins of civilization generally fit into four different categories:
1. **Managerial** - Civilizations arose out of the need to manage some kind of resource (water resources, good flood control). Makes sense, since people are getting something out of it.
2. **Internal Conflict** - Civilizations developed to prop up people who have already claimed a higher status. Hard to test, since its difficult to separate cause and effect.
3. **External Conflict** - People gathered into densely populated clusters for defensive reasons, and got safety from outside threats. Building of walls as monumental work likely support this theory.
4. **Synthetic** - Any combination of the earlier ideas.

Different civilizations may arise for different reasons, and we should not look for a single, simplistic reason for why civilizations arose.
