# Defining Primates
Primates are a rather non-descript mammalian order that cannot be characterized by a single derived feature shared by all members. Definition requires a combination of derived features.

Primates are defined on a basis of behavioural, adaptive, and evolutionary tendencies. There are around 500 species identified.

There is a great range in size and habitat of primates.

> Most in sub-tropics and tropics, but span very hot and cold climates

Primates contain three core characteristics:
1. Flexible body, arboreal signature (being able to move around in trees)
2. Dietary plasticity
3. Parental investment

## Flexible anatomy with Arboreal Signature
Primates have a generalized skeletal structure.
1. All non-human primates are quadrupedal (move on 4 limbs, brachiating, vertical clinging and leaping, knuckle-walking)
2. Upright upper body posture
3. Upper/lower limbs and major joints separate (flexible shoulder joint/clavicles)

### Sensory Emphasis on Touch
Primates have an enhanced sense of touch, with sensitive fingertips and toetips. There is the presence of **dermal ridges**(finger and toe prints), which enhance our tactile sense and reduce slipping.

> Nails instead of claws, which protect and support digits

### Sensory Emphasis on Vision
Primates have a reliance on vision. We have **stereoscopic vision**, which gives us the ability to see in three dimensions. They are enclosed by a **bony orbit** that protects the eyes.
* Post-orbital bar in prosimians
* Post-orbital plate or cup in monkeys, apes, and humans.

Colour vision is very common, with the exception of nocturnal prosimians.

> Eyes are very close together and forward facing, which gives us our ability to see in three dimensions

As a result, we have a a decreased reliance on smell. There is a reduction in snout size and olfactory areas of the brain.

## Dietary Plasticity
Primates as an order are very adaptable in what they eat, and the wide range of food sources they can use.
* Animals
* Insects
* Fruits
* Seeds
* Flowers
* Young leaves
* Mature leaves
* Woody stems
* Sap
* Gum
* Underground parts

## Parental Investment
Primates usually have one offspring at a time, and longer birth intervals. As a result, parents space their offspring out over years between births. Primates have long periods of **preadult care**.

This behaviour is important to the primate order, because of the benefits of social learning. Primates often live in complex communities and groups, and so infants and babies need a long time to learn the rules and be a good member of the community. As a result, we have extended life spans.

Primates have large brains for their body size, especially the neocortex, which controls for higher functions like memory, problem solving, and abstract thought.

> Humans are well above the average mammal and other primates, in terms of brain mass relative to body mass.
