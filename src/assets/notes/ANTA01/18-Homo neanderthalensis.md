# *Homo neanderthalensis*
We start to see *Homo sapiens neanderthalensis*, or *Homo neanderthalensis* around $130,000$ years ago.

Some features of Neandertals craniums are likely to be primitive retentions from *Homo erectus* ancestry.
* **Curved brow ridges** - Brow ridges are curved instead of straight, like in *Homo erectus* (think of McDonald's arches)
* **Occipital bun** - Swelling at the back of the skull like a nuchal torus, but in Neandertals, it is more developed (raised, rounded area of bone)
* **Midfacial prognathism** - Looks like they've been grabbed by the nose and pulled outwards
* **Nasal aperture** - Appeared to have very large nostrils, providing lots of room to warm and moist cool, dry air.
* **Larger cranial capacity** - Modern inuit populations have larger brains than modern humans, so likely a cold climate adaptation
* **Large body mass** - Very robust individuals, and quite large overall

Neandertals span across Europe and Western Asia. We do not have evidence of Neandertals being in Africa, or Far East Asia. However, *Homo heidelbergensis* from Africa and China overlaps with the time of Neandertals.

Skeletally, Neandertals were incredibly sturdy hominins.
* **Robust bones, and large joint surfaces** - Associated with transferring a lot of force.
* **Wide scapula** - The bone has more surface area to attach larger muscles to.
They also had wide hips and chest, and short distal extremities.

**Allen's rule** states that in cold climates, extremites tend to be shorter than in warmer climates. In cold climates, we want to minimize surface area to minimize heat dissipation, while in hotter climates, we want to maximize surface area to cool down.

## Atapuerca 5
From the find that we discussed earlier, we start to see Neanderthal traits at Sima de los Huesos, although not all the distinctive neanderthal traits are present.

## Krapina
Classic Neandertals with the full set of Neandertal traits don't appear until $130,000$ years ago. This partial cranium from Croatia is among the oldest hominins displaying the full set of traits.

## Gorhams Cave
There is some debate, about how long the Neandertals survived for. A site at Gorham's cave in Gibraltar, suggests that Neandertals survived to $28,000$ years ago, where the climate was more moderate. Others suggest the Neandertals went extinct, due to their hyper adaptation to cold climates and falling temperatures. They may have overlapped with modern humans in Europe for a period of between $2600$ and $5400$ years.

## Kebara 2
We have more complete skeletal remains of neandertals compared to earlier hominins. This skeleton is dated to about $60,000$ years old, and found in Israel.

They were fully bipedal as modern humans. They have short, bread, laterally directed iliac blades associated with bipedalism.

![[1657411266.png]]

 The completeness of the statue is due to cultural practices of the Neandertals. We have clear evidence that they were the first hominin to bury their dead. 

![[1657411467.png]]
> We can tell that the specimen is buried, due to the positioning of the body. It seems placed on its back, with arms folded on its chest.

## Shanidar 4
Found in Iraq, and dated to about $60,000-70,000$ years ago. There is evidence that hominins were buried with flowers in their burial site. Faunal specialists could detect the types of pollen associated with the grave. The pollon came from flowering plants, and is present in higher concentrations than other parts outside of the cave.

## Shanidar 1
Looking at another individual from a different burial, we see signs of altruism in Neandertal behavior since the individual had major pathological problems, but the injuries had shown evidence of healing, and lived to an older age for Neandertals, between 30 and 45 years old.

![[1657411829.png]]
> This specimen had signs of a crushing fracture on the left side, and probably led to blindness and brain damage. However, the fracture had healed.

![[1657411838.png]]
> Humerus on the left had degenerated significantly. Also evidence they lost their right forearm or hand at some point.

![[1657412131.png]]
> Individual was likely deaf, Found with bony growths in the ear canal.

## Moula-Guercy
At a site in France, about $120,000-100,000$ years ago, there is evidence of Neandertal cannibalism. Their bones were broken in the same way that other animals were treated. However, it was not widespread.

Some modern humans also practice cannibalism as well, so we cannot say that this is descriptive of the whole species.

![[1657412327.png]]

## El Sidron
In El Sidron, Spain, there is evidence of tool marks on homosapien bones, which is also suggestive of cannibalism. Neandertals living here were quite undernourished, with evidence of malnutrition. 

![[1657412514.png]]
> E - dental hypolasia, evidence of developmental stress
> F - mandible with coothmarks suggesting cannibalism
> D - interproximal grooves, neandertals used toothpicks!

If cannibalism was practiced here, it was likely in the case of dietary emergencies. This suggests survival cannibalism, instead of ritualistic cannibalism.

## Mousterian Tools
Mousterian tool culture is closely associated with Neandertals, and is considered a retouched flake technology. Tool types are created by delicately retouching a flake after it has been struck from the core.

![[1657472934.png]]
> Neandertals had a lot of tool types associated with them

These were a major advancement over earlier tool making efforts. Rather than relying on the "Swiss army" rock of earlier efforts, Mousterian tools are more tool-specific. This suggests a greater amount of intellectual processing going into planning their tools.

Some tools were designed to be hafted or attached to a shaft. For the first time, humans were making composite tools (made of two or more parts).

## Umm el Tlel
Syrian site dated to around $40,000$ years ago, has produed faunal evidence of hunting in Neandertals. Additionally, it's possibly the first time that humans were using glue.

![[1657473338.png]]
> Fragment of a spear point in a vertebra of a wild ass. Also found evidence of bitumen (black substance) used to help haft a stone tool on a handle

Their patterns of fractures and injuries are similar to those partaking in rodeos, which suggests that spears were thrusted instead of being thrown.

## Chatelperronian Tool Industry
Later Neandertals are associated with the Chatelperronian tool industry. It shows continuity in some types of tools, suggesting that it developed out of the Mousterian. Includes more blade tools and bone tools, which represents a new raw material being used in the archaeologic record.

![[1657473887.png]]

It has been suggested that this tool industry incorporated these elements as an imitation of tool types used by modern humans, since these were associated with early *Homo sapiens* in Europe and Africa. Chattelperronian only developed in areas where Neandertals and modern humans had their closest contacts.

## Creative Expression
There is debate over whether Neandertals were capable of symbolic thought, since this is almost entirely lacking in the Neandertal archaeological record. Until recently, there are almost no cave paintings, attributed to Neandertals. We believe that these are one-offs rather than part of their everyday lives.

### La Roche-Cotard Mask
![[1657474114.png]]
> Mask dated to around $32000$ years ago, found in La Roche-Cotard, France. Could be a chance appearance, or a mask.

### Cave Scratches
Scratches were found in Gorham's Cave, Gibralter, and dated to $39,000$ years ago. Since they were found below Neandertal tools, and an area where *Homo sapiens* aren't known in this area, it is likely the scratches are made by Neandertals.

![[1657474407.png]]

### Cave Art
Recent discovery in 2018, that is clear evidence of Neandertal cave art in Iberia, dated at $64,800$ years ago. Modern humans were not in the Iberian peninsula until $20,000$ years later.

![[1657474539.png]]

### Jewellry
Jewellry has been associated with late occuring Neandertal fossils. Discovered in Arcy-sur-Cure, and dated to about $44,000$ years ago. It suggests some aesthetic sense, but it is not until *Homo sapiens* when we see an increase in creative expression. 

![[1657474677.png]]

### Speech?
Neandertals had similar hyoid bones to modern humans, with a similar positioning of the larynx. Their thoracic vertebra were also scaled like a modern humans, meaning they had no physical impairments to being able to speak.
