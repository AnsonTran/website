# Haplorrhines
Suborder of primates that are considered the 'higher' primates, including tarsiers, monkeys, apes, and humans. Haplorrhines share many traits that are not seen in Strepsirrhines. Also called **anthropoids**.

> Tarsiers are a problem here since they share many traits with both Strepsirrhines and Haplorrhines

## Tarsiers
Tarsiers are **nocturnal** Haplorrhines all in Southeast Asia, which eats insects, frogs, and lizards. They contain aspects of both Strepsirrhines and Anthropoids.

> Tarsiers span five species have a grooming claw, but lack a rhinarium and dental comb. Its elongated tarsal bones gives them vertical clinging and leaping abilities

![[1656896765.png]]
> Has huge eyes, that are the size of its brain. In addition, its head can rotate 180 degrees, similar to an owl.

In older textbooks, tarsiers may be classified as Strepsirhines. However, with DNA and genetic analysis, we found that they are more closely related to us than with lemurs.

## Anthropoidea
The infraorder of Anthropoidea is further separated into two parvorders.

![[1656897811.png]]
> Platyrrhines, are Central/South American monkeys that have flat noses, and broad, round nostrils.

![[1656897818.png]]
> Catarrhines, include Asian/African monkeys, apes, and humans. They have narrow, slit like nostrils.

## Platyrrhines
Also called **new world** monkeys, platyrrhines (flat noses) live in forested areas in southern Mexico and Central/Smouth America. They are mostly arboreal, and small bodied compared to Asian/Afrian monkeys.

![[1656897820.png]]
> Most are diurnal (awake at day, asleep at night), with the exception of Owl Monkeys

![[1656897821.png]]
> All have external tails, with some being prehensile such as the Spider monkey (able to seize, grasp, hold using the tail)

![[1656897819.png]]
> Howler monkeys make a loud hooting sound, generated by an enlarged hyoid bone that almost takes up its entire throat.

## Asian/African Monkeys (Cercopithecoidea)
Also called **Old World** monkeys, they are **catarrhines** (downward facing noses), all in Asia and Africa. They are terrestrial and arboreal species, with all of them being diurnal. These monkeys have external tails, although not prehensible.

They span two sub-families:
* **cercopithecines** (cheek-pouch monkeys)
* **colobines** (leaf eating monkeys)

> Macaques are the most widely distributed non-human primate, and live in a diverse range of climates

## Apes
Apes can be separated into the **great apes**, and the **lesser apes**. The main difference between the two are size. Characteristics of apes are:
* Larger body size
* No external tail
* Short trunk
* Arms longer than legs (except humans)
* Shoulder modifications (allowing them to brachiate)
* More complex behaviour and social systems than other primates
* Larger, more complex brain thatn other monkeys
* Apes invest even longer amounts of times than other primates

### Gibbons and Siamangs
Gibbons and siamangs are lesser apes, found in tropical forests in Southeast Asia, and traverse using brachiation.

![[1656897824.png]]
> Gibbons and siamangs live in long-term pairs, and will not reform bonds with other mates when their current mate dies.

### Orangutans
Orangutans are almost completely arboreal greater apes, that live in the South Asian islands of Borneo and Sumatra. Even though they are quite large, they are primarily **frugivores** (eats fruits), and thus need large territories to gather enough fruit for themselves. As a result, they are solitary apes.

![[1656897825.png]]
> Orangutans are **sexually dimorphic**, meaning that males and females are visually different from each other.

### Gorillas
Gorillas are the largest of the living primates, that live in Central Africa. With a high degree of sexual dimorphism, dominant silver-backed males are often twice the size of females. They are primarily **folivores** (eat leaves), and travel in groups of one large silverback male, a few adult females, and offspring.

![[1656897823.png]]
> Gorillas are primarily terrestrial, walking using their knuckles

### Chimpanzees and Bonobos
Chimpanzees and bonobos are the closest living relatives to humans (sharing ~$98\%$ of our genes), living in the forests of Central Africa. Mainly frugivores (eat fruit), and quadrupedal (knuckle-walking) with occasional bipedalism.

They have a highly developed social structure. Similar to humans, sex is not exclusively for reproduction, often used to strengthen social bonds, or simply to have pleasure.

![[1656897826.png]]
> Bonobos are more arboreal than chimps. We think that they are calmer, and less aggressive too.

## Humans (*Homo sapiens*)
Humans are the only bipedal great ape, found everywhere! We have a similar dental morphology to other apes, but have a small, miniscule canine, reduced throughout our lineage. Humans are terrestrial, with a wide range of activities and aggression levels. Sex is not exclusively for reproduction. We navigate our world using spoken language and cultural innovations, possibly due to our enhanced cognitive capacities.
