# Evolutionary Processes
A change in genetic structure of a population from one generation to the next

## Adaptation
A feature of an organism that increases the likelihood of its survival and reproduction in a particular environment.

> The body shape of sharks and dolphins are better adapted to the ocean environment

## Adaptive Evolution
Evolution of multiple divergent species from a single, less specialized ancestral species. Often occurs on islands (e.g., the Galapagos).

> A single finch species evolves over time into many different species, in order to fill different niches.

## Natural Selection
Natural selection utilizes the variation among species that already exists. How each organism fares in its environment decides whether it will pass its genetics to offspring.

The tenets of natural selection:
1. Variation exists
2. Variation is heritable
3. Some variants are better adapted to deal with their environment than others
4. If left unchecked, every organism will produce more offspring than can survive
5. More offspring of the better adapted variants will survive
6. These offspring will have the adaptations of their parents
7. Over time, this will lead to a change in the population to resemble the better adapted variants
8. Over a long enough time-frame, this will produce large scale changes, including speciation

> Every giraffe has variation, but over time, the ones with longer necks survive

If there is not enough variation in the species (all giraffes had short necks), there is the possibility that a drought would cause the species to become extinct.

## Artificial Selection
In contrast to natural selection, artificial is selection by humans for characteristics that are considered more desirable. Can lead to a very different set of features becoming common than would have characterized that population if it had only been under natural selection.

> Dogs, cats, grapes, fruits, etc. have all been articially selected

This can lead to species that fare very poorly in natural environments, in contrast to artificial environments.

## Sexual Selection
Selection on features or behaviours associated with mating. There is a trade-off that needs to be made between sexual selection and surviving in the natural environment.

### Male-Male Competition
Competition over access to females. A peacock's tail would cause it to become more visible to predators, but would make them more attractive to females.

### Female Choice
Females get to choose who they will mate with, since sperm is cheap. Females expend a lot of energy growing offspring.

Humans participate in sexual selection as well, selecting based on cultural factors (culture, religion, wealth, etc.). Can lead to in-breeding.

## Mutation
A change in DNA. It can refer to changes in DNA bases as well as changes in chromosome number or structure. It is only important to evolution if they occur in sex cells. It is the ultimate source of all variation.

## Genetic Drift
An evolutionary change as a result of random processes. Particularly significant in small populations, or populations that don't have variation.

### Gamete Sampling
Changes in genetic material passed on the next generation as a result of random chance. Mixing of genes from mom and dad are random, and not set. 

### Fission
A population separates, and the resultant populations may have a different genetic makeup than the original population.

### Founder Effect
A part of the population leaves to start a new breeding population somewhere else. The new population may have a different genetic makeup than the original one.

### Bottleneck Effect
A restriction of genetic variability, with a decrease in population size. Often caused by a disease or a catastrophe of some sort.

Cheetahs almost reaching extinction and then rebounding, would have a smaller pool of genetic variability.

## Gene Flow
Can be thought of as the opposite of inbreeding. It is the exchange of genes between populations. Has the effect of making populations **more similar** to one another.
