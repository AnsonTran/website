# Evolutionary Thought
## Greek Philosophy
The view from Greek philosophy, was that species were fixed and unchanging. Any variation that did occur within species was undesired, or unimportant.

## Al-Jahiz (776-868 AD)
Translated the works of Aristotle, bringing it to the masses. He wrote about the struggle for existence, and recognized that stronger animals outcompete each other for resources.

## Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406 AD)
Wrote an important tome, called Muqaddimah. He wrote about
* The relationship between primates and humans
* How humans developed from the world of monkeys based on cognitive similarities
* Species becoming more numerous with time

## The Scientific Revolution
With the scientific revolution in the early 17th century, Europeans began to increasingly question the nature of the world, and made many new discoveries. These led the groundwork for development of the scientific method, which seek to explain natural phenomena.
* Discovered North and South America
* The globe being round
* Earth rotating around the sun
* Solar system, physics, new scientific instruments, etc.

## Creationism
Before evolution became widespread, most thought about how life came to be followed these basic tenets:
* The Earth was created by God relatively recently
* Large scale changes to the Earth's surface are the product of major catastrophes
* Living things do not change through time
* Fossils can be explained away

## Uniformitarianism
The theory that the earth's features are the result of long-term processes that continue to operate today as they did in the past. The Grand Canyon would be explained as being eroded away, through a process that started millennia ago and still occur today.

## Catastrophism
The theory that large-scale catastrophes shape how the Earth looks today. The Grand Canyon for example, would be formed as the result of an enormous flood, with a magnitude not witnessed today.

## James Hutton (1726-1797)
An important figure in uniformitarianism is James Hutton, who modeled the Earth as a self-regulating system. He saw the processes operating on the Earth's surface as a cycle that was present in the past and continues today.

## Sir Charles Lyell (1797-1875)
Wrote a book called Principles of Geology, that provided evidence to support the theory of uniformitarianism. This evidence contradicts the notion that the Earth was created recently, with a long time scale necessary to get the Earth to look the way it does today, and for evolution to act.

## James Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829)
Lamarck was aware of the apparent relationship between an organism and its environment. Believe the mechanism of adaptation was inheritance through acquired characteristics. Any changes to an animal's body made during its life, is passed on to its offspring.

## Thomas Malthus (1766-1834)
One of the key contributors to the idea of biological evolution. Observed that while food supply stays relatively constant, populations can increase exponentially, which implies that plants and animals produce more offspring than can survive. Although he noted that humans faced the same problem, he used this idea to preach that there was no point feeding the poor.

## Charles Darwin (1809-1882)
Charles Darwin put together the ideas of evolution in the books On the Origin of Species, and The Descent of Man. He voyaged around the world, and saw the wide breadth of life.

An important island was the Galapagos, where the animals that thrive there depend on what animals manage to reach those islands, and how they adapt according to the opportunities on the island that is available to them.
