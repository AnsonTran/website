# Human Variation
Variability between modern humans, are affected by three factors:
* **Endogamy** - Non-random mating within some group (e.g. cultural, religious, etc.). Tends to make members of a group more similar to one another.
* **Local adaptation** - Adaptation to the local environment. ``
* **[[03-Evolutionary Processes#Gene Flow|Gene Flow]]** - Exchange of genes between populations, making populations more similar.

## Human Skin Color
A good example of local adaptation is the relationship between latitude and skin color. People who live closer to the equator typical have darker skin, than those further from the equator. This is found to be an evolutionary tradeoff to the local environment. 

Lighter skin is considered an adaption, allowing more sunlight to penetrate the skin, maximizing vitamin D synthesis, which helps with:
* Absorption of calcium
* Prevents rickets in children

Darker skin protects against UV rays, which can cause:
* Sperm damage
* Avoid folate breakdown
* Spina bifida in babies

However, skin color does would show a much more regular pattern if climactic conditions were the only factor. Instead, we see a gradiation in terms of skin color.

## Race Model
The race model assumes that when humans arrived at a particular place, they stayed only in those places, breeding locally and evolving based on local conditions. Through isolation from other groups, they become more similar to one another, and accumulated differences from other groups producing **clusters**.

It predicts that members of any cluster should have more in common with one another than with members of another cluster. We should be able to clearly and unambiguously identify these clusters based on shared similarities.

A study by Lewontin in 1972, tested this theory. It looked at how variability was patterned within and between human groups. Lewontin found that only about $6.3\%$ of variation was between human "races", while the other $93.7\%$ of variation exists within groups.
