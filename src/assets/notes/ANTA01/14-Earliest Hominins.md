# Earliest Hominins
Hominins are the species that are more closely related to *Homo Sapiens* than any living great ape.

## Unique Human Features
 In order to recognize hominins, we look at features unique to humans, but are missing or absent to other hominins. Particularly, chimpanzees and bonozos, who are our closest human relatives.

Features unique to humans include:
* Extremely large brain (~850 kya)
* Anatomical features associated with **bipedalism** (walking on two limbs) (4.4 mya)
* Very small canines, compared to other mammals and primates (decreasing through human evolution)
* Relatively flat faces (orthognathic faces) (~1.8 mya)
* Ability to modify raw materials into recognizable tool types (3.3 mya)
* Chin (195 kya)
* Ability to both learn and invent language
> In comparison, prognathic faces are forward-jutting

## Scenarios of Human Evolution
These features did not appear instantaneously, so we would like to know the ordering with which they appeared in our lineage.

The first two features of humans are the most important, which leads to two possible scenarios for human evolution.

**Brain first**: The big brain is the most distinctive human feature, and therefore has been evolving for the longest time

**Bipedalism first**: Humans began walking on their hindlimbs first, which freed the hands for tool use, leading to brain expansion

Fossil material suggests a **bipedalism** first scenario for human evolution.

## Piltdown I (*Eoanthropus Dawsoni*)
In 1908, an amateur geologist named Charles Dawson discovered what appeared to be cranial pieces of a human fossil in a gravel pit in the south of England. Charles's discovery attracted the attention of Sir Arthur Smith Woodward, and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.

The three individuals went back to the gravel pit in 1912, and uncovered more skull fragments, as well as a jawbone.

Additionally, they found non-primate fossils that included mastodon and hippo specimens.

The cranium fragments were clearly human, but the jaw fragments were ape-like. In 1913, a small canine tooth was discovered in the gravel pit, which supported the argument of a brain-first evolution. Piltdown man was dubbed *Eoanthropus dawsoni*.

However, Piltdown man turned out to be a hoax! The jawbone fragments turned out to be an oragutan mandible with canines filed down. Scientists used fluorine dating in order to debunk this.

## Taphonomy
Taphony is the study of all of the events from an organism's death to its discovery as a fossil.

## Ardipithecus ramidus (~4.4 mya)
![[1656975373.png]]
*Ardipithecus ramidus* is a hominin species found in the Awash region of Ethiopia. Since there was volcanic activity in the area, Argon-Argon dating was used to estimate the age of the species to be ~$4.4$ million ears old. 

With about $45\%$ of the skeletal remains found, **Ardi** is the most complete specimen found to date. The fossil was completely flattened by limestone, and took about a decade to reconstruct, from discovery in 1995, to its reveal in 2005. Along with Ardi, there are ~110 other fossils of this species found.

*Ardipithecus ramidus* had a chimp-sized brain (~$300-350$ cc), and an anteriorly positioned foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord and brain connects). This positions the head on top of the vertebral column, for balance and support during bipedal locomotion.

Another distinct feature is a short, broad pelvis with laterally (pointing outwards) oriented iliac blades like humans. The iliac blades of the pelvis face towards the sides, whereas in great apes they face towards the back. This shorter, broader bowl-shaped pelvis gives support and proper muscle attachment locations for bipedal locomotion.

> If we look at a chimpanzee walking bipedally, it will move side to side to regain balance. This is due to the difference in the shape of the pelvis.

It also retains some primitive features that are not present in humans, mainly an opposable big toe. Although the species likely walked bipedally, they most likely were still capable of climbing trees.

> Our big toe aligns to be straight with other toes, whereas here, the big toe goes out to the side

The species also had a canine that was intermediate between a human, and a chimpanzee.

## Australopithecus afarensis (3.9-3 mya)
With over 300 fossils found of this species, *Australopithecus afarensis* is the better known species from this time period. Unlike Ardi, we can confidently conclude that this species walked bipedally, and is in our lineage.

![[1656979119.png]]
> Lucy, discovered in 1974, is one of the most complete fossil skeletons of any known human relative, at about $40\%$ complete

Lucy's pelvis is much better preserved than Ardi's. It is short and broad, with a laterally oriented iliac blade. Lucy's femur has an assymetrical end where it articulates with the knee, indicating bipedalism.

> The human femur is angled inward (bicondylar angle), towards the middle of our bodies, which aids in stabilization during bipedal locomotion.

![[1656980479.png]]
> Due to the angled femur, the kneecaps are placed near the center of our body (valgus knee)

In Tanzania 1976, paleontologists also found fossilized footprints (Laetoli footprints). After a volcanic eruption, a group of hominins travelling together walked across this muddy and ashy plain. Estimated to be about 3.7 million years old.

![[1656980480.png]]
> Laetoli footprints are similar to humans, with a big toe in line with the rest of the feet

*Australopithecus afarensis* still had a chimp-sized brain (average 420 cc). Canines are smaller than *Ardipithecus ramidus*, but larger than humans.

> Chimps have a rectangular dental arcade, humans have a parabolic dental arcade. *A. afarensis* has a dental arcade somewhere in between.

## Paranthropus boisei (2.2-1 mya)
Discovered in 1959, *Paranthropus boisei* was found in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. It was initially announced as a human ancestor, but found to be an offshoot of human evolution that did not lead to modern humans.

Features of the species suggests it was specialized for heavy chewing. This includes large molars, relatively small front teeth, a crest at the top of the skull (for muscle useful during chewing), and broad cheekbones.

## Lomekwian Tool Culture
The oldest stone tools are the Lomekwian tool culture, with stone tools about 3.3 million years old, found in Lomekwi, West Turkana, Kenya. They seem to be made in a fundamentally different way from other stone tools, by taking a big rock and hitting it against another big rock.

Hominins were not hunting at this time, and there were no members of the genus Homo around 3.3 million years ago. This suggests that the Homo genus were not the only ones using tools. It is presumed that a species of australopith made them.
