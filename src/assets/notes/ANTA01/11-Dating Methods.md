# Dating Methods
There are two ways we can date material, either **relative** or **absolute** dating.

**Relative dating** gives a relative ordering of material or sites
* Stratigraphy
* The Law of Faunal Succession
* Cross dating

**Absolute (chronometric) dating** provides an actual chronological age, usually with an error range, for an object or a part of a site.
* Radiocarbon dating (carbon-14 dating)
* Potassium-Argon
* Argon-Argon

Archaeologists use a combination of multiple dating methods and take multiple samples, to account for instrument errors and for accuracy.

## Stratigraphy
Studying the sequential layering of deposits. The stratigraphy of a region can be produced by a variety of processes, including wind, floods, lava flows, etc. which leaves sediments on the Earth's surface.

> **Principle of superpositioning**: In a stratigraphic sequence, the lower layers were deposited before the upper layers.

The stratigraphic layers can be messed up due to a variety of factors:
1. **Human activity**: People digging into the layers, in order to bury something (can be easily noticed through the cut marks in the layers)
2. **Geological processes**: Tectonic plates coming together, could cause the layers to be twisted and rotated in different ways.

> A **stratigraphic column** shows the relative positions of layers at a locality

Excavating the site is an archaeologically destructive process, since the **context** of where an artifact is found is just as important as the artifact itself. Information on artifacts must be recorded as we excavate, so that we can date it relative to other items we find.

> We can **physically correlate** many sites across a region by linking the geological layers (strata) based on their physical characteristics

The collision of an asteroid ~$65$ million years ago, spread large volumes of ash across the Earth. As a result, we can see a spike in Iridium in the sediment layers. This allows us to physically correlate events all cross Earth!

## Law of Faunal Succession
Stratas at multiple sites can be physically correlated using the presence of fossils. If they both contain fossils of the same animals, they should be of the same age. 

In order for faunal succession to work, we need an **index fossil** of known age. The animal should be a broadly distributed species, that is only around for a short duration (half a million to a million years).

## Cross-Dating
Estimates the age of artifacts and features based on their similarities with comparable materials from dated contexts.

> An experienced archaeologist familiar with an artifact, can tell the time period based on the characteristics of the artifact.

## Radiocarbon Dating
Radiocarbon dating, or carbon-14 dating, is currently the best-known absolute dating method.

Recall that an atom is made up of a neutron and proton core, and electrons. The atom is assigned an element based on the number of protons present, but can vary in the number of neutrons as different **isotopes**.

> The Carbon-14 isotope is very rare, and is used in radiocarbon dating

Carbon-14 is a very rare isotope in nature, and wants to lose one or two neutrons to return to a stable form. It undergoes radioactive decay, by gaining a proton to become nitrogen.

> While we're alive, we're continually taking in new carbon as it decays. However when we die, we're not taking any new carbon sources, lowering Carbon-14 levels.

The time period that half the amount of a radioactive isotope is converted to a daughter product is measured in **half-lifes**.

> In the case of Carbon-14, we know that it decays into Nitrogen-14 with a half-life of ~5730 years.

The amount of Carbon-12 remaining in a fossil remains the same, so by comparing the amount of Carbon-12 to Carbon-14 in the artifact, we can estimate the years elapsed since the organism died.

> Carbon-14 decays exponentially, so it becomes difficult to date artifacts over ~30000 years old

## Potassium-Argon Dating ($^{40}K-^{40}Ar$)
When volcanic rock is formed from cooling lava, all the argon gas is lost from the lava flow. The rock or ash will have radioactive Potassium-40.

Potassium-40 has a half-life of $1.25$ billion years, and is used to date **volcanic material** that is ~$100,000$ to $4.6$ billion years old.

> While we can't date the fossil itself, we can date the volcanic ash in the strata below and above it

## Argon-Argon Dating ($^{40}Ar-^{39}Ar$)
A variant of the Potassium-Argon dating technique. It is more accurate, and can be used on smaller samples. While Potassium-Argon dating requires the ash to be at least ~$100,000$ years old, Argon-Argon is more successful when measuring more recent contexts.
