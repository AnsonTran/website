# Introduction
Anthropology is the study of humans. Almost every discipline we can think of, to some extent, studies humans. The difference, is the scope of study. Anthropology is global, and stretches back to the earliest stages of human evolution.
* We talk about longer time frames than history, which studies written word
* We have a broader geographical perspective than sociologists or psychologists apply.
* Stretches to all societies, both in the present, and in the far past.
* Incorporate all aspects of what it means to be human, including both the cultural and biological side of humans.

This broader scope allows anthropology to have an often more holistic or complete understanding of the human experience than other disciplines.

## Cultural Anthropology
Studies all aspects of human adaptation including technology, traditions, language, religion, and social roles. Culture is a set of learned behaviors; it is transmitted from one generation to the next through learning and not biological or genetic means.

Sometimes referred to as ethnology, social anthropology, or socio-cultural anthropology.

## Linguistic Anthropology
A sub-field of anthropology, although it is sometimes considered a sub field of cultural anthropology. It includes languages that have no written form, and which require field work to study.

## Archaeology
Archaeologists primarily emphasize material culture, "the physical manifestation of human activities, such as tools, art, and structures". We focus on the things that people made or modified, such as:
* Stone tools that were dropped or left
* Different kinds of weaponry
* Garbage heaps

These provide an amazing source of information on past humans. We don't necessarily focus on human bones or human remains. This subfield offers the possibility of studying cultural change over a vastly longer time frame than history, which focuses on the written record. The archaeological record extends over 2 million years before the first written record.

### Prehistoric Archaeology
The traditional realm of archaeologists, studying the human past that predates the written record.

### Historic Archaeology
Studies the remains or stuff left behind by people who have a written record. 

### Bioarchaeology
Studies human, animal, and faunal remains in an archaeological context. Helps us understand what humans at the time ate.

### Cultural Resource Management
If there is a new condo development, CRM would excavate part of the site before the building process, to see if there are any archaeological remains. 

> "The safeguarding of the archaeological heritage through the protection of sites and through salvage archaeology... generally within the framework of legislation designed to safeguard the past"

## Evolutionary Anthropology
Also referred to as physical anthropology, or biological anthropology, this subfield is interested in the broad range of topics that encompass all aspects of the biology of humans and our relatives, including living and extinct primates. Its goals include:
* Documenting and understanding modern human variability
* Trying to understand our evolutionary history

### Osteology
The study of bones. Osteologists often work in conjunction with archaeologists

### Forensic Anthropology
Study of human remains in a legal context, working within the court system.

### Medical Anthropology
Study of human health and disease, our healthcare systems, and biocultural adaptations of humans to their environment. Spans a wide range of interests and time periods.

### Molecular Anthropology
Subdiscipline that aims to use genetic material of living people or fossil hominins to answer questions about how people have dispersed in the past, migrations people did, and where the variability in the human species originate from.

### Paleoanthropology
The study of human paleontology. Human fossils, our immediate relatives, back about 2-5 million years

### Paleoprimatology
An extension of paleoanthropology, which looks at the fossils of non-human primates.

### Primatology
The study of living non-human primates, such as apes, monkeys, lemurs, etc. We study these to gain a better understanding of early human behavior, or what our culture might have been.
