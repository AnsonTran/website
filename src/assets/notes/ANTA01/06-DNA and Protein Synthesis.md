## DNA and Protein Synthesis
## Early Theories
### James Watson (1928-), Francis Crick(1916-2004)
Described the structure of DNA molecule in 1953. At the time, people thought that DNA was the source of genetic material, but didn't know the structure of how the molecule worked to pass on the information of inheritance.

### Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958)
Used X-rays to figure out the structure of the DNA molecule itself. Indicated that the DNA was a double helix.

## Structure of DNA
DNA consists of two backbone sides and nitrogenous bases held together by a hydrogen bond.

The backbones are made of:
>*P*-Phosphate
>*S*-Sugar

The nitrogenous bases are:
>*A*-Adenine
>*T*-Thymine
>*G*-Guanine
>*C*-Cytosine

> A always bonds with T
> C always bonds with G

## Structure of the Cell

### Nucleus
The control centre of the cell, and contains nuclear DNA. You get half from mother, and half from father.

### Ribosomes
The protein manufacturing centers of the cell. They do not reside in the nucleus. Information contained in dna molecules get translated into proteins in the ribosomes.

### Mitochondrion
The energy producing part of the cell. It contains mitochondrial DNA (different from the nuclear DNA), which you get only from your mother.

### Chromosomes
Nuclear DNA is packaged in the nucleus of the cell, into structures called chromosomes.

### Messenger RNA
Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) is similar to a molecule of DNA, except it has:
* One more oxygen
* Only a single helix
* Bases include Uracil (*U*) rather than Thymine (*T*)
DNA is copied onto the RNA in the process of transcription.

### Transfer RNA
Made of an anticodon on one end, and an amino acid on the other end. Its a set of three bases that corresponds to another three set of bases on the MRA that codes for a particular amino acid.

## Protein Synthesis
 The information in the chromosomes need to be transferred out of the nucleus to the ribosomes, in order to be useful to the body.

### Transcription
Part of a DNA molecule is temporariliy separated at the bases. The sequence of base pairs are then copied onto a molecule of messenger RNA. mRNA is smaller and only contains a portion of the DNA, so it can enter and exit from the nucleus as it pleases.

### Translation
The mRNA moves out of the nucleus and attach onto a ribosome. It recruits transfer RNA (tRNA) specifically encoded to different amino acids, and grows a long line of amino acids. The chain of amino acids forms a protein.
