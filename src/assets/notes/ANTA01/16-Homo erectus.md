# *Homo erectus*
*Homo erectus* has been around for a very long time, from ~$1.8$ million years ago, to ~$40,000$ years ago. We start to see more modern human-like proportions in terms of height, shorter arms, longer legs, etc. Brains were still smaller than in modern human, but larger than early *Homo*. Technological innovations included the use of more advanced tools, and likely the use of fire.

*Homo erectus* is also the first species we know of, that moves outside of Africa all the way to Europe and far eastern Asia.

> Eugene Dubois (1858-1940) is credited as the discoverer of the first *Homo erectus* fossils

Darwin noticed that the closest human ancestors were the chimps and bonobos, predicting that we would find our intermediate human ancestors in Africa. However, Dubois considered Asia to be a more likely place to find the human-ape missing link.

> Fossils of *Homo erectus* from Trinil (originally named *Pithecanthropus erectus*). Angled femur and centered kneecaps, which supports bipedalism.

 > The size of the skullcap also fits neatly between that of a chimpanzee and later neandertals.
 
 The Trinil material was difficult to date due to lack of good note-taking. Other finds, include:
 * Sangiran material, dated to be ~1.6 million years old
 * Ngandong material, dated to be ~40 thousand years ago

## Peking Man
Fossil material of *Homo erectus* was also found in a Zhoukoudian cave, in China. Material was dated to ~$780,000$ years ago, and included a number of skulls and post cranial bones (arms, legs, fingers, hands, knees, hips, etc.). This material was termed **Peking Man**.

> Average cranial capacity of 900cc, with thick cranial bone
> Nuchal torus for muscle attachment suggests thicker neck muscles

These individuals were short, stocky hominins about $5$ feet in height. Much taller than *Australopiths* and *Homo habilis*, but still short and stocky. 

Sadly, the original fossils from the cave were lost during the second Sino-Japanese war (1937-1945). The only material we have left, are molds and casts made from the original.

These fossils demonstrate that *Homo erectus* had succeeded in being broadly distributed across Asia. Current evidence suggests they originated from Africa.

## *Homo ergaster*?
More recent discoveries of *Homo erectus* come from Africa. The best preserved skull comes from Lake Turkana, Kenya, discovered in 1975. The skull is dated to ~1.7 million years ago, making it amongst the oldest dated specimen of this species from Africa.

> Has some characteristics from the Zhoukoudian finding, with no sagittal keel

Based on the differences between this finding and others, some researchers suggest that material coming out of Africa should be a different species called *Homo ergaster*.

## Nariokotome boy
Nariokotome boy, found in the west of Lake Turkana, Kenya, is the most complete finding of *Homo erectus*, about $40-45\%$ complete. It is dated to be about ~$1.6$ million years old.

> Nariokotome boy displays all the characteristics of bipedal hominin locomotion.

The skeleton is of a sub-adult (anything below an adult), believed to be about 8-12 years old. The specimen had a extensive dentel abscess (bacteria invades the tooth root), which can spread to the brain and other areas of the body. If left untreated, can lead to septic shock.

In contrast to the individual found in China, this individual was already 5 foot 3. Extrapolating to adulthood, the individual could be very tall. This is likely a pattern of adaptation to the hot climate, by maximizing body heat being lost.

## Dmanisi
A recent discovery, Dmanisi is a site in the Republic of Georgia where lots of *Homo erectus* material was found. The material was dated to ~$1.81$ million years ago. Researchers were excavating a medieval castle, but came across pleistoceine mammals, Oldowan tools, and five skulls.

![[1657051770.png]]
> Skills were quite small with ~650cc cranial capacity

We are not sure whether these skulls belong to *Homo erectus*, or some earlier hominin species that migrated out of Africa.

## Acheulian Handaxes
Earlist *Homo erectus* still had tools that were a little bit more advanced than Oldowan tools. However, ~1.75 million years ago, we started seeing a new tool industry associated with *Homo erectus*. The toolkit lasted about a million years.

![[1657052956.png]]
> Handaxes, flaked on both sides (bifaces) and fashioned to look like a teardrop

![[1657053090.png]]
> Created using soft-hammer percussion. Instead of using a second rock, we use an antler or bone, to precisely flake
> Small-scale modifications are made to make it sharper, called **retouching**

These tools were ubiquitous, and could be used for many different uses, including:
* Scraping
* Breaking open bones
* Digging
* Sexual selection
* etc.
Some bigger tools might have been made for aesthetic reasons, instead of practical ones

There's no evidence that these were placed onto spears, so it's unlikely that these were used for hunting.
## Chopper-Chopping Tool Industry
Hallam Movius noticed that there was a divide called the **Movius line**. Acheulian handaxes were found west of the line, whereas east of the line, there were no Acheulian handaxes found. 

![[1657053689.png]]

Instead, we find modified choppers and flake tools, similar to the Oldowan stone tools. There were minor advancements to the Oldowan tools.

![[1657053842.png]]

Possible reasons for the Movius Line. It is likely a combination of the three:
1. Eastern *Homo erectus* left Africa before the invention of the Acheulian handaxe
2. More reliance on non-stone tools (i.e. bamboo) that took the place of the handaxe
3. Raw materials suitable for making handaxes weren't available

## Fire
Fire is considered a major step in human cultural development, as there are many positive consequences:
1. Extends the activity period, providing light in the evening and warmth at night
2. Opportunity to cook food, for more nutrients and food sources
3. Scare predators

We know that *Homo erectus* had to ability to harness fire (keep a fire burning if lightning strikes a tree), but we don't know if they can control it (light it on demand). 

However, we do have evidence that hominins were using fire, in Wonderwerk Cave, South Africa, which had a long period of occupation. Forty metres into the cave, there is evidence of fire, meaning that there is no way lightning could strike into there.

## Homo naledi
A recent find in Rising Star Cave, South Africa. It required many different types of absolute dating, and was dated to about 241 thousand to 335 thousand years ago. It has produced over 1500 pieces of bone, belonging to at least 15 individuals. It is the largest assemblage of a species that has been discovered. Although its not as old, it looks far more ancestral than any  *Homo erectus* we have.
* Smaller braincase than *Homo erectus*, with a brain capacity of 465-560 cc
* Physically smaller, with adult males being about 5 ft tall

In many ways, *Homo naledi* is more similar to *Homo habilis*, or the *Homo erectus* found in Dmanisi. Based on the broad range of variability, *Homo naledi* might be a small African variant of *Homo erectus*. Other researchers consider it to be too different and too ancestral.
