# Strepsirrhines
Suborder of primates found in African and Asian tropics and subtropics. They retain some ancestral and primitive traits that are not seen in other primates. Because they're the most ancestral part of our order, they are the best living analogies to extinct early fossil primates.
> Lemurs, Lorises, Galagos, Aye-ayes

Characteristic traits include:
* Good sense of smell (Rhinarium - moist nose)
* Prehensile hands and feet with nails on most digits (they often retain one ancestral grooming claw)
* Tooth comb on the lower jaw
* Stereoscopic vision
* Don't have a fused mandible

## Lemuriformes
Lemuriformes have the highest degree of diversity among living primates, that exist solely in Madagascar. They fill various ecological niches, and express a wide range of behaviours.

> Lemuriformes form about $21\%$ of all primate genus, belong to five families, and encompass about 100 species.

Similar to Darwin's finches, lemuriformes somehow arrived at Madagascar as the only primate species there. Adaptive radiation took place, with lemuriformes diversifying and filling all sorts of ecological niches.

Every lemur is highly threatened, with lots of them on the endangered species list.

## Lorisiformes
Lorisiformes include the families Loridae and Galagonidae.

### Lorises
Lorises are **nocturnal**, **arboreal** (live in trees) primates, that reside in Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, and Africa. They eat insects, fruits, eggs, snails, and lizards.

> Lorises form two families, and span 11 species
> Sunda slow loris (*Nycticebus coucang*), has a toxic bite

### Galagos (bush babies)
Galagos are **noctural** primates, with excellent leaping abilities, that reside in Sub-Saharan Africa. They eat fruits, insects, and gum.

> Galagos span 20 species

### Aye-ayes
Aye-ayes are the world's largest **nocturnal** primates, and are related to lemurs. There are no woodpeckers where aye-ayes live, and so they fill that niche.

> A good hint that a primate is nocturnal, is if it has large eyes, that help them to collect lots of information

> Aye-ayes have an unusual feeding habit. They climb around in branches, and use a long, skeletal middle finger to extract insects
