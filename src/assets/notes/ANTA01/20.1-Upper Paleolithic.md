# Upper Paleolithic
The Upper Paleolithic starts about 50,000 years ago. It's a period of incredibly rapid change, with flourishing of cultural activities associated with anatomically modern humans. The upper paleolithic is characterized by:
* More refined stone tools, especially blades
* Increased use of raw materials other than stone
* A more varied diet
* Larger, more permanent habitation sites and dwellings
* Long distance trade
* Items of personal adornment
* Increasingly elaborate burials
* Creation of art
* Increased geographic range

## Blade Making
Blades are defined as a flake that is at least twice as long as it is wide. They're removed from a prepared core by striking the platform with a indirect percussion (not hitting with a stone directly). Alternatively, blades can also be removed by pressure flaking.

## Aurignacian Tool Industry
The Aurignacian tool industry is associated with early anatomically modern humans in Europe, between 40,000 and 27,000 years ago. Similar to the Chattelperonean, it incorporates blades and stone tools. Blade tools are even more advanced, and bone is used more often than in the Chatelperronian tool industry

## Gravettian
Succeeding the Aurignacian, starting between 27,000 to 21,000 years ago, the Gravettian starts a trend that takes us into the Mesolithic era. We see smaller blades, and deticulate tools (worked to have small, toothlike projections on the cutting edge). This makes it a serrated edge, which can be more efficient for cutting materials.

## Solutrean
The Solutrean tool industry lasts from 21,000 to 18,000 years ago. It is one of the most distinctive, and contains some of the most aesthetically pleasing stone tools made, akin to a laurel leaf.

> Blades are leaf-shaped, very thin, and very finely bi-facially flaked

## Magdalenian
The Magdalenian tools spans from 17,000 to 11,000 years ago. It is characterized by very small microblades, which can be set into a wood or bone handle. These are the first replaceable parts in tool making. It also includes needles for sewing hides. It is best known for its development of non-stone tools, including bone and antler tools.

## More Varied Diet
A wide variety of prey were taken when we analyze the faunal assemblages. We find fish, small mammals, shellfish, and plant material. Fish nets and fish hooks are also used, which increased the type of prey we could catch.

## Permanent Habitation Sites
Associated with increased populations, we start to see more permanant habitats being built by human populations.

> Dolni Vestonice, a dwelling that housed about 25-50 people. About 27,000-26,000 years ago in the Czech Republic

## Long Distance Trade
We start to see people being more choosey about their choice of raw materials in tool making. Material is being found at considerable distances from its source, suggesting long-distance trade taking place.

> Ostrich eggshell beads are found in archaeological sites where they are not endemic to the region.

## Personal Adornment
As we saw in the newer tool cultures, tools were intricately decorated and crafted. However, we also see humans expressing themselves in the creation of adornments. We see an increase in the use of all types of raw materials.

> Teeth and bone pieces made into pendants and beads. Magdalenian period pendant.

> Ostrich eggshell beads, from Enkapune Ya Muto, Kenya dated around 40,000 years ago.

## Elaborate Burials
We see a trend towards increasingly elaborate burials, which we first saw with the Neandertals. Here, we start to see grave goods, adornments, etc. being buried with the dead.

> Sungir burials, 25,000 years ago in Sungir, Russia. Adult and child being laid head to head. They were burried with >3000 mammoth ivory beads. Earliest elaborate anatomically modern human burial.

## Cave Paintings
Artwork is being created in many different types and in abundance. Suggests that people had time, as well as specialized artisans to create artwork.

> Dates for the oldest cave paintings in Europe (oldest 40,800 years old) associated with *Homo sapiens*.

The oldest cave paintings in Europe appeared at almost the same time with the first [[20.1-Upper Paleolithic#Aurignacian Tool Industry|Aurignacian]] tools. This suggests humans were not making art before humans moved into Europe, where we see a sudden growth in artistic expression. However, this is not true.

Paintings can be found in other parts of the world outside of Europe. This one comes from Blombos Cave, South Africa and predates the oldest cave art in Europe, dated to about 73,000 years old.

> Grooved lines thought to represent abstract art. Ochre is a soft mineral, which can be grinded into powder. It can be mixed with oil, grease, or water, which can be spread over the body for sun and bug protection.

Cave paintings were also found in Sulawesi, Indonesia and dated to be about 45,000 years old. This is thousands of years older than the oldest cave paintings in Europe.

While we don't know what the cave paintings could be used for, we believe that they could be:
* Trophies for major kills
* A type of sympathetic magic (if i draw a bull, i might be able to kill a bull)
* Illustrations used in storytelling

## Portable Art
As well as cave paintings, we also see portable artwork in upper paleolithic sites.

> Venus of Willendorf figurine, around 25,000 years ago in Austria. Depicts a well-endowed woman, without faces (hair covers the face)

## Cultural Explosion
Although we see examples of symbolism farther back in the archaeological record, we see an explosion of widespread symbolism around 40,000 years ago. We don't know why for sure!

We believe it could be the appearance of language, which provides an additional means of communication, and acts as a catalyst for new transfers of ideas, and rapid cultural change.

Other factors could be environmental pressures, or increased social interaction (coexistence of Neandertals and modern humans for the first time in Europe).

## Increased Geographic Range
During the upper paleolithic, we see an increase in the geographical range of modern humans. We see our extension to further extremes of the globe than we've seen earlier, reaching virtually all corners of the globe. 

### Warratyi Rock Shelter
From a site in Warratyi rock shelter, Australia, we start to see the first evidence of human activity around 49,000 years ago. 

![[Pasted image 20220714143034.png]]
> Shelter has a blackened ceiling (soot), egg shell fragments, and bone tools

### Mungo Man
Skeletal remains about 40,000 years ago from Southern Australia. It lacks robust features of modern Australian aboriginals. *Homo erectus* had been around in Trinil, but with the use of watercraft, modern humans were able to move into Australia.
