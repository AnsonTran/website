# Genetics
## Early Theories
### Gregor Mendel (1822-1884)
Considered the "father of genetics". He worked at the same time as Darwin, and performed a series of pea breeding experiments.

At the time, most scientists in the nineteenth century assumed that inheritance happened as a result of blending together of both parents.

What would happen if you mate a plant that consistently produces smooth peas with one that consistently produces wrinkled peas?

**Blending inheritance** suggests that you would get somewhat wrinkled peas. In several generations, peas would look more and more intermediate.

**Particulate inheritance** would have both smooth and wrinkled peas. In several generations, there will be both types of peas in predictable proportions.

## Genes
A sequence of DNA bases that specifies the order of amino acids in an entire protein, portion of a protein, or any functional product.

**Alleles** are alternate forms of a gene (e.g., smooth vs wrinkled). For any particular trait, you would have two alleles of that gene.

**Homozygous**: The individual possesses two of the same alleles for a particular trait (SS or ss)

**Heterozygous**: The invididual posseses two different alleles (Ss)

**Dominant allele**: Some alleles must be able to suppress the ability of the other. This allele is the one that is expressed in a heterozygote.

**Genotype**: The genetic makeup of an individual

**Phenotype**: The observable or detectable physical characteristics of an organism

> **Phenotype** is smooth vs wrinkled
> **Genotype** is ss for the wrinkled, and either Ss ro SS for the smooth
