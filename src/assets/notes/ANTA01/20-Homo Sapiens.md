# Homo Sapiens
Modern humans belong to the *Homo sapien* species. As we discussed previously, Neandertals were present across western and central Asia, and mixed in time period with the appearance of modern humans. We will try to answer the following questions:
* Where did modern humans come from?
* Did local populations in Europe and Asia contribute to the modern human gene pool?
* Were these local populations replaced by a new wave of immigration from Africa?

## Evolutionary Models
These models try to answer the question of where modern humans come from.

### Recent Out-of-Africa or African Origins (RAO Model)
The RAO model suggests that populations of *Homo erectus*, Neandertals, and *Homo Heidelbergensis* in Europe had died out, and were entirely replaced by immigration of annatomically modern *Homo sapiens* from Africa.

From the fossil record, we should expect that:
* Anatomically modern *Homo sapiens* appears first in Africa
* There is evidence of intermediates **only** in Africa
* The first anatomically modern specimens known from any non-African area are African in appearance

> [!info] The discovery of modern human fossils in China that shares some earlier hominin traits, means there are intermediates outside Africa

For genetic evidence, we should expect that:
* Genetic variability is greatest in Africa
* Neandertals should be equally distantly related to all modern humans

> [!info] All non-African people share about $1-4\%$ of Neandertal DNA, so it's not equally distant.

### Multiregional Evolution (MRE Model)
The Multiregional Evolution model suggests modern humans in Europe, Asia, and Africa evolved independently from different Homo species populations in those regions. Extensive gene flow between these populations maintains populations as a single species, with *Homo sapiens* ability to interbreed.

From the fossil record, we should expect that:
* Anatomically modern *Homo sapiens* appear at a similar time in multiple places
* There is evidence of intermediate forms in all geographic areas
* The first anatomically modern specimens share features with earlier occuring hominins in each area

> [!info] There is a lot of variability in time between first appearances of modern *Homo sapiens*. We only find intermediate forms in Africa and Asia, but not in Europe. 

For genetic evidence, we should expect that:
* Amounts of genetic variability evenly distributed across Africa, Asia, and the Middle/Near East.
* Shared genetic material between Neadertals and non-Africans.

> [!info] Oldest and most diverse sequences of DNA were found in Africa and not evenly distributed.

### Leaky Replacement Model
Overall, we see that neither model fully fits the evidence that we have. The leaky replacement model suggests that some aspects of both model are true.

Most of the evidence leans towards the out-of-Africa replacement model, but genetic evidence shows theres measurable amounts of interbreeding between archaic populations. Modern humans came from Africa, but did not completely replace other *Homo* species.

## Earliest Fossils Found in Africa
Our earliest evidence for *Homo sapiens* comes from Jebel Irhoud, Morocco. They were excavated $>50$ years ago, and believed to be recent. However, with re-dating, they were found to be ~300 thousand years old.

> Craniums from an adult and a juvenile. Cranium is long and wide, but a vertical forehead and clear chin. Shows a combination of modern human and archaic traits.

We also have some early evidence from Omo Kibish, Ethiopia. Originally found in 1967, it was recently redated to ~$195$ thousand years old.

![[Pasted image 20220713222330.png]]
> Has a mixture of primitive and modern characteristics

From Herto Bouri, Ethiopia, we have 2 adults and 1 juvenile craniums dated to about $~160-154$ thousand years ago.

![[Pasted image 20220713222517.png]]
> Has a high forehead, rounded crania, and canine fossa. In comparison to modern humans, it has larger teeth and supraorbital tori.

These fossils provide substantial evidence that supports the out-of-Africa model for human evolution.

## Homo sapiens outside Africa
The first appearance of anatomically modern humans outside Africa was in Mt. Carmel, Isreal, around $120-90$ thousand years ago.

![[Pasted image 20220713223002.png]]

There's no evidence for anatomically modern humans in Europe until ~$40$ thousand years ago. When we do find them in Europe, they do not look like the Neanderthals. By ~$50-40$ thousand years ago, modern humans are widespread. 

However, as we move into East Asia, we find some fossils that have a mixture of archaic and modern human features.

> Found in Jinniushan, China, and dated to ~200,000 years ago. It has large browridges, thin cranial bones, broad nasal bridge, prominent cheek bones, and shovel-shaped incisors

The oldest anatomically modern human specimen we have, is dated to ~67,000 years ago, and found in Liujiang, China. However, it shares some features with older archaic species. The continuity of features provides some evidence for the MRE model.

> An anatomically modern human, but retains some characteristics of its ancestors

## African DNA Evidence
In 1987, a paper was published that provided molecular support for the RAO model. It looked at DNA sequences of mitochondria from 148 modern humans with ancestries from different areas of the world.

![[Pasted image 20220713231423.png]]

All of the oldest sequences of DNA are African in origin. If the multiregional pattern of evolution were true, we shouldn't expect to see a pattern, since everyone would be mixed up together. Since Africans had the most basal sequences, it supports the idea of a long lineage stretching out of Africa and replacing populations.

More recent studies have come to similar results. We always find that there is more genetic variability in Africa than other parts of the world.

## Neandertal DNA Evidence
A study of Neandertal mtDNA shows significantly more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) shared by Neandertals and non-African moderns than with African moderns. 

![[Pasted image 20220713232053.png]]

From mitochondrial DNA, it does not suggest very high levels of interbreeding. However, it is impossible to exclude the possibility of low levels of interbreeding since you can only get mitochondrial DNA from your mother.

The first Neandertal nuclear DNA study shows that Neandertals share similarities with people from Europe, China, and Papa New Guinea, but not people from Africa. Studies show that $1-4\%$ of nuclear DNA come from Neandertals.

Interbreeding did happen with the *Homo sapiens* that eventually led to these human groups. The ability to interbreed implies that Neandertals are not a distinct species, but a sub-species.

## Denisovans
Neandertals were not the only pre-modern group with whom *Homo sapiens* interbred. The Denisovans are a pre-modern population from Denisova Cave, Russia. Their designation is based solely on genetic material, since there were few skeletal materials known. The DNA comes from a tiny fingerbone, which turned out to have different DNA makeup.

![[Pasted image 20220713233002.png]]

Denisovans were interbreeding with other humans, specifically populations from Melanesia. Neandertals and Denisovans also interbred. Suggests modern humans were migrating on their way down to Australia when they came across the Denisovans.
