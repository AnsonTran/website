# Neolithic
To put food production and agriculture into context, we need to define the two geological time periods:
* **Pleistocene** - Time period (epoch) stretching from 1.8 million years ago to 10,000 years ago. Latter part is sometimes referred to as the "Ice Age"
* **Holocene** - Time period (epoch) starting 10,000 years ago and continuing to the present. At the beginning of the Holocene, the glaciers begin to recede.

> Pleistocene refers (mostly) to the time before the ice age, while Holocene refers to time after the ice age

The neolithic time period is the third period of the stone age, defined by the introduction of agriculture. An important distinction, is that not all places reached the Neolithic phase at the same time. In some places of the world, people never adopted agriculture. The neolithic dates from around 12,000 years ago, varying from place to place.

## Neolithic Celts
Neolithic celts, used for chopping wood, are characterized by the polishing of stone tools. The stone was likely flaked, and then polished using various grits of other stones. It helps in the effectiveness of the tool, and took a long time to make.

## Pottery
During this time frame, we begin to see pottery beginning to be made. Pottery was not made in a potter's wheel, rather made using slabs/coils of clay that were then burnished and polished to make them smooth on both sides. Then, they were fired in kilns that became increasingly sophisticated in designs.

The adoption of pottery making was due to an increase in sedentism (living in one place for a long time). Pottery is heavy, easy to break, and are hard to haul around if following herds.

## Agriculture
Early agriculture began to appear independently in different parts of the world between 12,000 and 8,000 years ago. Different types of agriculture were domesticated in different parts of the world.

Settlements that practice agriculture, would have tools that are more specific to agriculture. We start to see these tools in the upper paleolithic, but they become much more abundant now that people are practicing agriculture.

With the production of a more stable food source of animals and/or plants, we see the development of larger, longer term habitation sites, with higher population density. People start to become more sedentary, since the agriculture has to stay put and cannot be moved.

## Domesticated Animals
Domesticated animals have distinctive features that differentiate them from wild animals:
1. **Size changes** - Smaller individuals and teeth, making them more manageable than larger individuals. Includes cows, dogs, etc.
2. **Defensive/Offensive characteristics** - Smaller canines, tusks, etc. that make them tamer than their wild counterparts.
3. **Pathological changes** - Reduce the ranges of animals, and making them unable to live their normal lives.
4. **Population characteristics** - Humans had control over which animals would breed, and which animals would be killed for food.
5. **Geographic distribution** - Animals may be found in an area where they did not exist prior to humans moving there

Domesticated animals and plants began to appear in the Neolithic. Dogs are the first domesticated animal, which evolved from the wild wolf *Canus lupus*. Selective breeding produced the enormous range of dogs we have today. Dogs were bred for various reasons, possibly starting with companionship, herding other animals, etc.

Cats were domesticated later than dogs. Current studies suggest that there were at least two domestication events for cats:
* A type from China, domesticated from the Leopard cat
* Modern house cats, domesticated from the wild cat.

If we look at all the modern cats in China today, they derive from the wild cat. This suggests that the domesticated Leopard cat were completely replaced by the Wild cat variant.

Pigs, which are domesticated from boars, grew smaller, with smaller jaws, and a reduction in canine tusks.

![[Pasted image 20220721160904.png]]

Cows grew smaller in size, saw a reduction in horns, etc. to make them more managable to control. Managability is a lot more important factor to early humans than how much meat they provide.

![[Pasted image 20220721161120.png]]

Animals also suffer pathological changes, that don't allow them to live their normal lives. Horses may wear a bit, which causes their teeth to be worn down. Animals are kept in pens, which lead to weaker bones.

![[Pasted image 20220721161443.png]]

People had greater control over which animals could breed, and which animals would be killed for food. In goats, males are likely to be killed since they do not produce goods such as milk, and cannot reproduce. Females are more likely to be kept until an older age.

Horses are not native to North, Central and South America. If we find animal bones that do not exist prior to animals moving here, we can conclude that humans brought them here.

## Flotation
Plants are delicate, making it difficult to recover organic remains. This method depends on the fact that material from an archaeological site has different densities. Organic material such as seeds, would float in water, while things like stone tools would sink. 

## Domesticated Plants
Distinctive features can differentiate them from wild plants:
1. **Geographic distribution** - Food crops can be found where they did not exist natively
2. **Seed size changes** - In plants, we want large seeds, and larger fruits.
3. **Changes in seed dispersal mechanisms** - Want to make the seeds of plants more accessible

Food crops can also be found where they did not exist natively, such as corn, tomatoes, cocoa, and potatoes. These are from the Americas, but are not staples in many other parts of the world. 

![[Pasted image 20220721162438.png]]

In general, domesticated plants have larger seeds than their natural or not-selected-for predecessors. Larger seeds are associated with plants that germinate more quickly, are easier to spot, and have good stuff we want to eat.

Corn originated from the Teosinte plant. By cross-breeding it with a Teosinte mutant plant over many generations, we now have the modern corn plant. Seeds fall off more quickly, and at the same time as opposed to the Teosinte plant. Researchers suggest maize could be the first genetically engineered plant.

The *Brassica oleracea* plant, known as wild cabbage, leads to many different types of veggies that we eat today. These plants were selected for different characteristics. Virtually every type of plant or animal eaten by humans has been influenced by selective breeding.

## The Fertile Crescent
An area in Southwest Asia (Near East), where the Mesopotamian culture/civilization later developed.

Around 12,000 years ago, the Natufian culture is found here. The earliest Natufians were non-agricultural people (mesolithic). Their food choices shared some things in common with later agriculturalists.

Two plants became domesticated as early as 11,000 years ago, including the Einkorn, and the Emmer. It took some time for domesticated food sources to become the primary source of food. People were still hunter-gathering.

## Deh Luran Plain
In the Deh Luran Plain (southwestern Iran) between 9,450 to 6,950 years ago, a series of archaeological sites document the progressive increase in importance of domesticated food sources in the diets of people living there. 
* Domesticates form small part of the diet, population low
* Increased food production, increased population
* Irrigation leading to even higher food output
* Greater population increases

## Tehuacan Valley, Mexico
Squash was the first domesticated crop in the Americas. However, corn/maize quickly became the key food source once it was domesticated.

Similarly to the Deh Luran Plain in Iran, we see an increase in reliance on domesticated crops between 12,000 and 1,500 years ago through a sequence of archaeological sites.
* Small seasonal camps, few or no domesticates
* Larger more permanent camps, more domesticates
* Increase in sedentism, increase in food production

![[Pasted image 20220721165741.png]]

The gradual increase in the importance of agriculture is mirrored in the progressive changes in the maize farmed by the inhabitants.

## Diffusion/Migration Hypothesis
The diffusion/migration suggests agriculture arose in one area for local reasons and spread to the rest of the world.

However, signs for early agriculture in broadly separated parts of the glode appear at nearly the same time and the earliest domesticates are usually local.

## Oasis Hypothesis
The oasis hypothesis suggests drying occured in the Holocene period, which led to sedentary concentrations of humans in areas where plants could grow. The need would develop to produce more food to support this sedentary population.

However, there is no evidence of desertification occuring after the ice age. Additionally, early archaeological sites were not oases with perfect weather and rainfall. Wouldn't explain the need for irrigation to develop in the Fertile Crescent.

## Readiness Hypothesis
When people were intellectually ready, and had accumulated enough of an understanding of plants and animals in their region, they naturally began to domesticate them.

This is not necessarily correct, since no human evolutionary change is associated with the advent of agriculture. It doesn't explain the timing or rapid spread of agriculture, and fails to acknowledge the negative aspects of agriculture.

Foragers, hunter gatherers who lived in these regions, had a vast encyclopedic knowledge of the plants and animals in those areas. People were thriving well before agriculture took hold.

## Ecological Hypothesis
In normal, natural situations, populations will only increase up to the **carrying capacity** (maximum population of a specific species that can be maintained at a steady rate) of the area. With agricuture, it becomes possible to increase the carrying capacity of a given area to support a bigger "natural" population size.

This hypothesis takes into consideration the negative aspects of agriculture. It also matches the record from the Fertile Crescent and Mesoamerica, where we see a relationship between sedentism, population growth, and agriculture.

## Mistake?
Once humans begin agriculture, become sedentary, and increase population, they couldn't turn back. Once populations were above the natural carrying capacity of a given area, there's no way to revert back to a forager/hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

While we assume that a reliable food source would provide more food, allow people to be healthier, and increase populations, skeletal evidence suggests otherwise. We see more evidence of maulnutrition due to a narrow diet, compared to hunter-gatherers, who had access to more variety of food stuffs.

A sedentary lifestyle also exposes people to garbage and vermin. In contrast a nomadic lifestyle means you're not piling garbage in one place.

Agriculturalists tend to exhibit evidence for chronic illnesses and carious lesions, since they're eating sticky grains, with sticky carbohydrates feeding bacteria in the mouth. Some of the big illnesses we have today are transferred from domestic animals, such as tuberculosis.
