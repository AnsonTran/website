# Civilizations
Civilizations appeared at close to areas that were centers of the agricultural revolution. They are defined by the following characteristics:
1. Densely populated settlements
2. Food and labor surplus controlled by an elite
3. Social stratification
4. Formal government
5. System of record keeping
6. Specialization of labor
7. Monumental public works

## Densely Populated Settlements
### Mesopotamia
Mesopotamia is one of the earliest civilizations, and means *land between the rivers*, Tigris and Euphrates. It is located in the [[22-Neolithic#The Fertile Crescent|Fertile Crescent]], with one of the earliest cities being Uruk, about 5500 years ago.

### Teotihuacan
An early Mesoamerican city in Mexico, between 2200 and 1350 years ago. Has a population as high as 100,000 people.
* Large pyramids at different ends of the city
* Houses for normal people, able to house a lot of people in a small area

### Shaduf
The Shaduf irrigation system, moved water between irigation canals in Mesopotamia. They needed to be designed, maintained, and built, which required coordinated labor and extensive organization.

## Food and Labor Surplus Controlled by Elites
Initially, agriculture was very time consuming in the early populations, but as productivity increases, not everyone needed to be working in food production. This led to a labor surplus, managed by an elite.

## Social Stratification
In **Egalitarian** socities, such as those in the Paleolithic and Neolithic, similar members had equal rights, privileges, responsibilities, and wealth.

Civilizations became **Stratified** societies, which means some people are of a higher class. This could be due to political, familial, or economic reasons (i.e. you're a merchant and have a monopoly on sheep wool).

Housing provides good evidence for social stratification, and can be seen to this day (mansions vs. social housing).

Evidence can also be found, in the way that the dead are honored, and disposed of. A classic example are the pyramids in Ancient Egypt, where kings are buried. Other members of society would just be buried in the ground.

Elite members may be represented well in art. The Narmer palette, portrays Normer, who was thought to be the first Egyptian Pharoah, whom unified Upper and Lower Egypt around 5,000 years ago. He is depicted larger in size, with a crown, etc. compared to any other figures in the artwork.

## A Formal Government
Cultures could have a lot of ways in which the power structure is delineated. These societies were usually very *top heavy*, with a leader who has a monopoly over all decision making. 

### The Code of Hammurabi
One way rulers accomplished getting people to do things they didn't want to was through a tie between the leader and gods/deities. 

The Code of Hammurabi is claimed to be the first written law, written in *cuneiform* (first form of writing). A large portion of the text is devoted to the credentials of Hammurabi, and was written by his scribes.

## System of Record Keeping
Governments required ranks of people below the leader, to enforce the law and keep records (a bureaucracy). Without record keeping, there's no way to track who paid their taxes, or performed their service to the state.

> Rosetta stone, in Egyptian hieroglyphics. It provides key translations, between Heiroglyphs, Greek, and Demotic.

Record keeping does not necessarily have to be in written language. The Inca people used knotted strings called a Quipu, which kept track of statistics on everything from food supply, population, military campaigns, etc.

Sadly, we're not able to read a lot of them and what they mean. Individuals tied their knots slightly differently from each other, so the meaning were very individualized.

> Quipu contains a lot of information, in the number of knots, the forms of the knots, and the colors of the stream.

## Specialization of Labor
Specialization is a consequence of having a food and labor surplus. Hence, a division of labor between those who produced food, and those who did not, was possible. This allowed some members of society to become specialized in different jobs.

The archaeological record reflects this through artifacts people left behind, which required consistent levels of expertise. 

### Catalhoyuk
Catalhoyuk, was developed at a time when people were still getting used to agriculture and domestication. As a result, bricks were highly variable, and buildings merged together without any consistency. This indicates that there was likely no specialization of labor.

### Mohenjo-daro
In contrast, the Mohenjo-daro is build with bricks that have a consistent form. This indicates that people were specialized in making bricks.

### Bronze Gui
Another indicator of specialization of labor, are artifacts requiring an enormous amount of time and skill to make. The Shang Dynasty is agreed to be the first civilization in that part of the world. The intricate details of this ritual food vessel suggests the presence of specialized metallurgists (metal working specialist).

## Monumental Public Works
Monumental public works at this time are typically temples, or tombs. These were not utilitarian structures, and symbolized the wealth of that civilization. They likely served to focus and magnify the power of the upper classes of society.

Walls around cities, served to separate territories. The Ancient city of Great Zimbabwe in Africa, was part of a large and wealthy global trading network. Archaeologists have found pottery from China, Persia, as well as Arab coins.
