# International Trade
International trade deals with imports and exports:
* **Imports** - Goods and services purchased from other countries
* **Exports** - Goods and services sold to other countries

Countries can set up some barriers to trade:
* **Tariff** - A tax on an imported product
* **Quota** - A limit imposed on the total value or quantity of a good that can be imported each year
* Preferential government purchasing arrangements
* Product inspection and labeling requirements (and other regulations and red tape)
* Export subsidies and bans

## Canadian Trade
Canadian trade per capita is larger than in France, Mexico, China, U.S. and Japan
* In 2010, about 29% of the goods and services we produced were exported.
* In 2010, about 31% of the value of all goods we consumed were imported.
* Up from 15% in 1961

In absolute terms, Canada is one of the top 15 trading countries in the world.
* About 75% with U.S. (more manufactured goods from Canada go to the U.S. than stay in Canada!)
* About $550 billion of exports (in 2017)
* About $574 billion of imports

Canadian exports include:
* Motor vehicles and parts
* Industrial machinery
* Aircraft
* Telecommunications equipment

Canadian imports include:
* Machinery and equipment
* Motor vehicles and parts
* Crude oil
* Chemicals

## Theory of Competitive Advantage
A theory by an early 1800's London stockbroker, David Ricardo.
* Analyzed trade between Portugal and England.
* Considered wine and cloth as the two goods.
* England was a big manufacturing power
* Portugal was very underdeveloped, with very low wages

A country is an **autarchy**, if it is in a situation of **self-sufficiency**. Countries do not trade with each other.

### Canada
Canada has 15 units of labour. This labour can be used to produce either:
* 30 units of wheat
* 30 units of soybeans

Canada's production functions are:
$$S=2L_S,\ W=2L_W$$

The production possibilities frontier for Canada is:
$$\begin{align}
L_S&=0.5S\\
L_W&=0.5W\\
S=L_S+L_W=0.5S+0.5W&=15\\
S&=30-W
\end{align}$$

### Mexico
Mexico has 40 units of labour. This labour can be used to produce either:
* 10 units of wheat
* 20 units of soybeans

Mexico's production functions are:
$$S=0.5L_S,\ W=0.25L_W$$

The production possibilities frontier for Mexico is:
$$\begin{align}
L_S&=2S\\
L_W&=4W\\
S=L_S+L_W=2S+4W&=40\\
S&=20-2W
\end{align}$$

### Absolute Advantages
A country has an **absolute advantage** in producing a commodity if it *uses fewer resources* to produce that commodity

For Canada:
* 1 unit of wheat requires 0.5 units of labour
* 1 unit of soybeans requires 0.5 units of labour

For Mexico:
* 1 unit of wheat requires 4 units of labour
* 1 unit of soybeans requires 2 units of labour

Canada has the absolute advantage in both W and S!

### Comparative Advantages
A country has a **comparative advantage** in producing a commodity if it can produce that commodity at *lower opportunity costs*. A country can't have a comparative advantage in both goods, they can only tie.

Recall definitions of [[03-Production Possibilities Frontier#^cc2637|opportunity costs]]. The opportunity costs are:
* Canada has the comparative advantage in W
* Mexico has the comparative advantage in S

| |$OC_W$|$OC_S$|
|---|---|---|
|Canada|**1**|1|
|Mexico|2|**0.5**|

Before specialization, we have:
| |Wheat|Soybeans|
|---|---|---|
|Canada|20|10|
|Mexico|6|8|
|Total|26|18|

After specialization in each country's comparative advantage:
| |Wheat|Soybeans|
|---|---|---|
|Canada|30|0|
|Mexico|0|20|
|Total|30|20|

### Terms of Trade
The **terms of trade** are the rate at which a country's exports trades for its imports.

Suppose the terms of trade is:
* 1 wheat trades for 3/2 soybeans.
* 1 soybean trades for 2/3 wheat.

Under these terms:
* Canada could trade its 30 wheat for 45 soybeans
* Mexico could trade its 20 soybeans for 13.33 wheat

After specialization and trade, the **consumption possibility frontier**, shows that each country can consume more than they produce.

## International Imports
Through international trade, the equilibrium is shifted down, leading to an increase in consumer surplus. However, domestic suppliers can only supply below the international price.

## Import Tariff
Tariffs applied to imports have the following effects:
* A decrease in consume surplus
* An increase in producer surplus
* Tax revenue for the government
* Deadweight loss
* Reduction in imports

## International Exports
On the other hand, if there is international demand for a product, local consumers must compete at the higher price.

## Export Tariffs
Export tariffs have the following effects:
* An increase in consumer surplus
* A decrease in producer surplus
* Tax revenue for the government
* Deadweight loss
* Reduction in exports

## International Free Trade
Free trade increases the world's well-being, so every country can be better off. However, maximizing national income is not the only objective of the country. It must also consider:
* National security
* Cultural security
* Transmission of diseases
* Environmental effects
* The rules and operation of a free trade agreement
