# Technology
Most firms, most of the time, have no control over the production technology available. They have to adopt the existing technology.
$$q=f(K,L)$$
The output of the firm is a function of the physical capital $K$, and labour $L$. An example of a production function is the **Cobb-Douglas function**.
$$q=K^AL^B$$
Technology can change, depending on the time frame that we are looking at. However, this is dependent specifically on the industry being looked at.

**Short run**: Period is too short for firms to change production capacity of existing technology ($K$)

**Long run**: Period long enough for firms to change plant capacity, and for new firms to enter or exit the industry ($K$ can vary)

**Very long run**: Period long enough for technology to change (potentially)

| |Technology|Capital|Labour|
|---|---|---|---|
|Short Run|Fixed|Fixed|Variable|
|Long Run|Fixed|Variable|Variable|
|Very Long Run|Might Change|Variable|Variable|

### Example
Suppose we have the following long-run production function
$$q=(KL)^{0.5}$$
In the short run, capital has to be held constant
$$K=9,\ q=3L^{0.5}$$
Marginal product of labour is given as:
$$MP_L=\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta L}=1.5L^{-0.5}=\frac{1.5}{L^{0.5}}$$

**Law of Diminishing Returns** shows that we have diminishing marginal product of labour.
$$\frac{\Delta MP_L}{\Delta L}=-0.75L^{-1.5}<0$$
$MP_L$ intersects $AP_L$ at the maximum of $AP_L$
$$\begin{align}
\frac{\Delta AP_L}{\Delta L}&=0\\
\frac{\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta L}L-1q}{L^2} &=0\\
MP_LL-q&=0\\
MP_L&=\frac{q}{L}\\
MP_L&=AP_L\\
\end{align}$$
