# Production Possibilities Frontier
The production possibilities frontier shows a set of output possibilities feasible with a **fixed** amount of resources and a **fixed** technology.

It shows the set of output possibilities such that production of each good is the maximum possible, given the efficient production of the other good.

Points on the frontier of the PPF make the most efficient use of the resources. In order to produce more of $X$, we have to give up some of $Y$.

The opportunity cost of $X$, $OC_X$, is the amount of $Y$ that must be given up in order to get a little more of good $X$.
$$OC_X=-\frac{dY}{dX}$$ ^cc2637

The opportunity cost of $Y$, $OC_Y$, is the amount of $X$ that must be given up in order to get a little more of good $Y$. It is the inverse of the opportunity cost of $X$.
$$OC_Y=-\frac{dX}{dY}=-(\frac{1}{dY/dX})=\frac{1}{OC_X}$$


## Constant Opportunity Cost
Constant opportunity cost implies a *fixed* amount of one good must be given up in order to attain an additional unit of another good. In this case, the slope of the PPF is constant. There is a **constant** marginal product of factor inputs.

### Example
Suppose an economy has a PPF given by:
$$Y=60-2X$$
The opportunity cost of X is:
$$OC_X=\frac{-dY}{dX}=2$$

## Increasing Opportunity Cost
Increasing opportunity cost implies an *increasing* amount of one good must be **given up** in order to attain an additional unit of another good. The slope of the PPF gets steeper as the # of X increases. It can be explained by a **diminishing** marginal product of factor inputs.

As $X$ increases, $OC_X$ increases.
$$\frac{dOC_X}{dX}=-\frac{d^2Y}{dX^2}>0$$

### Example
Suppose an economy faces the following PPF:
$$Y=14-\frac{X}{6}-\frac{X^2}{12}$$
The opportunity cost of $X$:
$$OC_X=-(\frac{dY}{dX})=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{X}{6}$$
The opportunity cost depends on the level of $X$ being produced.

## Shifts of the PPF
Along a PPF, the amount of productive inputs and production technology are held fixed. Changes in the production factors and/or production technology will shift the PPF. Suppose there is an **improvement** in the production technology.

## Utility Function
How does society choose where to locate along the PPF? Suppose that society is able to express a social value of $X$ and $Y$ using a utility function, given as:
$$V=3X+6Y$$
We also have the PPF function given as:
$$Y=14-\frac{X}{6}-\frac{X^2}{12}$$
Since more $X$ or more $Y$ raises the level of value for society, we will end up on the PPF, and not below. So our optimum value will be an efficient point.

Since the PPF is strictly convex, our optimal point will be a point of tangency between the PPF and a constant value line (i.e. we are trying to get to the highest social value line we can achieve given our PPF).

At the socially optimal point, the slope of the PPF is equal to the slope of the (constant) value lines.
$$\begin{align}
V&=3X+6Y\\
&=3X+6(14-\frac{X}{6}-\frac{X^2}{12})\\
&=3X+84-X-\frac{X^2}{2}\\
&=84+2X-\frac{X^2}{2}
\end{align}$$
Solving for the maximum of the value function:
$$\frac{dV}{dX}=2-X=0$$
Substituting $X=2$ into the PPF function:
$$Y=14-\frac{2}{6}-\frac{4}{12}=13\frac{1}{3}$$
Our optimum point on the PPF is $X=2,Y=13.33$.
