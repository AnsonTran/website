# Gain to Society
**Efficiency** is achieved when resources are allocated in a way that delivers the most gain to society. The **gain to society** is the sum of [[07-Taxation#^cbb875|consumer surplus]] and [[07-Taxation#^0c7753|producer surplus]].
$$\begin{align}
\text{Gain to Society(GTS)}&=\text{Total welfare of participating in a market}\\
&=\text{Social welfare gained from...}\\
&=CS+PS\\
&=\text{Total Economic Surplus}
\end{align}$$

Producer surplus differs from profit only by the amount of fixed costs. So, gain to society can also be calculated from profit.
$$\begin{align}
PS&=TR-TVC\\
PS-TFC&=TR-TVC-TFC\\
PS&=\Pi+TFC
\end{align}$$

Marginal producer surplus is the same as marginal profit, since fixed costs are fixed.
$$\Delta PS=\Delta\Pi$$

### Simple Situation
In the simple situation, the benefits to society are the benefits to the individuals that are participating in consuming and producing. This means there are:
* No taxes or tariffs
* No external benefits (**positive** externality/spillover)
* No external costs (**negative** externality/spillover)
* No public goods

> **Positive externality** - A person pursuing education generally results in less crime, better outcomes, less stress on the healthcare system. Their consumption of a good/service leads to positive effects on others
> **Negative externality** - Smoking cigarettes causes health issues not only for themselves, but also people around them. Their consumption leads to negative effects on others

In the simple case, perfect competition **maximizes** the sum of surpluses to consumers and to producers. Hence, it has the largest gain to society and is efficient.

In other market structures such as a **monopoly**, there is a loss of efficiency. The **deadweight loss** or **efficiency loss** is completely lost to society, and is not transferred to someone else (as in taxes).

## Example
We can compare gain to society between [[13-Perfect Competition#Gain to Society|perfect competition]] and monopoly.

### Perfect Competition
Suppose there are 100 firms in a perfectly competitive market. In the long run:
1. Supply is given by $P=100$
2. Demand is given by $P=1000-Q$

![[Pasted image 20220813182652.png]]

1. Consumer spending is calculated as:
$$CS=0.5(900)(1000-100)=405000$$

2. Economic profit for firms is zero
$$\Pi_{LR}^*=(P^*-AC)Q^*=0$$

3. Gain to society is entirely captured by consumers
$$GTS=CS+\Pi=SW=405000$$

### Monopoly
Suppose a monopoly firm buys up all the firms and establishes a barrier to entry. The monopolist keeps all 100 plants separate and operates as many as he needs to supply the good.

1. The marginal revenue curve is calculated as:
$$MR=1000-2Q$$

2. Optimal quantity supplied by the monopolist:
$$\begin{align}
MR&=MC\\
1000-2Q&=100\\
Q^*&=450
\end{align}$$

3. Optimal price from the output:
$$P^*=1000-450=550$$
4. Consumer surplus:
$$CS=0.5(450)(1000-550)=101250$$
5. Profit:
$$\Pi=(P^*-AC)Q^*=(550-200)(450)=202500$$
6. Gain to society in the monopoly model
$$GTS=CS+\Pi=303750$$
7. Deadweight loss (or excess burden)
$$DWL=GTS_{PC}-GTS_{M}=101250$$
