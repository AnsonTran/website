# Opportunity Cost
The cost of taking an action is measured by the value of the **next best** alternative action. In other words, the value produced by the resources used, if you had used these same resources in an alternative way.

Based on scarcity of resources, if you do something, you have to give up doing something else you might have done. Opportunity costs consist of both **implicit** costs and **explicit costs**.
* **Explicit costs** - Money/monetary costs
* **Implicit costs** - Non-monetary costs (using your own resources)
$$OC=\text{explicit cost} + \text{implicit cost}$$

### Example
Your mother made you lunch, so you have an apple and a banana. She paid $10$ cents for the apple and $20$ cents for the banana. Suppose I don't have any lunch, and I'm hungry. I'd like to buy a piece of fruit from you. How much should you charge me?

> The wrong solution is to charge 30 cents for both. The next best option is to eat the items yourself, so the amount that should be charged is the level of joy from eating the fruit.

Suppose the level of satisfaction of eating the apple is worth $50$ cents. Then, the opportunity cost of the apple is:
$$
\begin{align}
OC_{Apple}&=\text{explicit cost}+\text{implicit cost}\\
&=.10+.50\\
&=.60
\end{align}
$$

## Cost-Benefit Decisions
When making decisions, we must account for the following:
1. We should only take actions where the **total benefit** of the action exceeds the **total cost**
2. If there are more feasible value creating actions than resources, we should do the action with the largest difference between $TB$ and $TC$. When resources are scarce, choices must be made about how these resources will be used
3. Care must be made to properly calculate $TB$ and $TC$, otherwise we might make improper choices.
4. In economics, we focus on how choices are made and what are the consequences of those choices. In a market economy, individuals make choices and then markets bring those individual decisions together.
