# Firms
Suppose we have a very small firm, with no market power. It has to accept the **going price**, making it a **price taker**.

For this firm, the price $P$ is constant, so total revenue is:
$$TR=P\times q$$

Marginal revenue is equal to the price, a constant:
$$MR=\frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta q} = P$$

For a price taker to maximize profit, it has to choose a quantity of output such that $MC=P$, the firms **profit-maximizing amount**.
$$\begin{align}
\Pi&=TR-TC\\
&=(P\times q)-(FC+VC)\\
&=(P\times q)-FC-\frac{VC\times q}{q}\\
&=(P\times q)-(AVC\times q)-FC\\
&=(P-AVC)q-FC
\end{align}$$

Profit equation can also be written as a function of average cost:
 $$\begin{align}
 \Pi&=TR-TC\\
 &=(P\times q)-(\frac{TC\times q}{q})\\
 &=(P\times q)-(AC\times q)\\
 &=(P-AC)q
 \end{align}$$

### Short Run Profit
In the short run, capital is fixed. The firm must choose a quantity that maximizes their profit.

Depending on the price set by the market, the firm may or may not be profitable. For the following three price levels:

|Price level|Profit|Description|
|---|---|---|
|$P<P_1$|$\Pi<-FC$|Shutdown condition|
|$P=P_1$|$\Pi=-FC$|Losing fixed costs whether operating or not|
|$P\in(P_1,P_3)$|$\Pi\in(-FC,0)$|Negative economic profit, making back some fixed costs|
|$P=P_3$|$\Pi=0$|Zero economic profit (Break even point)|
|$P>P_3$|$\Pi>0$|Positive economic profit|

### Long Run Profit
In the longer run, firms can choose the optimal amount of capital equipment. Firms must choose a level of capital (K), and in doing so picks a short-run average cost (SAC) curve to operate on.

Each level of K is optimal in the long-run for one level of quantity (q). At that quantity, the point on the associated SAC is also a point on the long-run average cost (LAC) curve.

The LAC curve is an envelope of *all* the lowest points attainable, one for each level of q, from all the different possible SAC curves.

## Returns to Scale
An increase in the level of output produced results in
* **Constant Returns to Scale (CRTS)** - No change in the LAC of production
* **Increasing Returns to Scale (IRTS)** - The LAC of production falling.
* **Decreasing Returns to Scale (DRTS)** - The LAC of production rises.

### Flat Long-run Average Cost
In the case where the LAC curve is flat, we observe the following:
* In the SR, increasing returns to scale exists
* In the LR, constant returns to scale exists
* No $q_{MES}$, as all scale/levels are efficient/competitive
* The lower envelope is at the minima of all the SAC curves

Quantity is a function of capital (K), and labour (L). If we vary both K and L by the same percentage, then the amount of output produced varies by the same percentage as well. 

Suppose initially, $L=L_0, K=K_0, q=q_0$.
$$\begin{align}
LTC_0&=P_KK_0+P_LL_0\\
LAC_0&=\frac{LTC_0}{q_0}
\end{align}$$
Now, employ twice as much K and L. This produces double the output.
$$\begin{align}
LTC_1&=P_KK_1+P_LL_1\\
&=2P_KK_0+2P_LL_0\\
&=2LTC_0\\
LAC_1&=\frac{LTC_1}{q_1}\\
&=\frac{2LTC_0}{2q_0}\\
&=LAC_0
\end{align}$$

### General Long-run Average Cost
In the general U-shaped LAC, there is an optimal $q_{MES}$, for the return to scale.
* Output below $q_{MES}$ is at an increasing returns to scale
* Output at $q_{MES}$ is at a constant return to scale
* Output above $q_{MES}$ is at a decreasing return to scale
