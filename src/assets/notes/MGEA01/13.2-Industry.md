# Industry
In a perfectly competitive industry, every firm is identical to one another. The market supply curve is a **horizontal sum** of all the individual firms supply curves.
$$\begin{align}
Q&=n\times q=\sum_{i=1}^{n}q_i\\
q&=\frac{Q}{n}
\end{align}$$
> q - level of output of a typical firm
> Q - industry output (supplied by all firms together)
> n - number of firms

Suppose the MC for each firm is given, and that there are 1000 identical firms:
$$MC=2+0.1q$$

A firms supply curve, where $P=MC$ (above AVC, of course) is:
$$P=2+0.1q$$

The industry supply curve is determined by substituting $q$ with the appropriate $Q$.
$$\begin{align}
P&=2+0.1q\\
&=2+0.1(\frac{Q}{1000})\\
&=2+0.1(0.001Q)\\
&=2+0.0001Q
\end{align}$$
> Must be above minimum AVC

### Example
Suppose the following functions are given for a PC firm:
$$\begin{align}
P&=154-0.06Q&\text{[Market Demand]}\\
TC&=3q^2+10q+432&\text{[Total Cost]}\\
FC&=384&\text{[Fixed Cost]}\\
\end{align}$$

Variable cost can be determined from total and fixed costs. Additionally, other costs can be determined as well:
$$\begin{align}
VC&=3q^2+10q+48\\
MC&=6q+10\\
AC&=3q+10+\frac{432}{q}\\
AVC&=3q+10+\frac{48}{q}\\
\end{align}$$

Minimums for AC and AVC by using calculus or finding the intersection with MC:
$$\begin{align}
MC&=AC\\
3q&=432/q\\
q^2&=432/3\\
q^2&=144\\
q&=12\\
\min AC&=\$82
\end{align}$$

Similarly for AVC:
$$\begin{align}
MC&=AVC\\
q^2&=48/3\\
q&=4\\
\min AVC&=\$34\\
\end{align}$$

The firm's supply curve is the MC curve, where $P\geq \min AVC$.
$$P=6q+10, P\geq\$34$$

If there are 100 identical firms in the industry, then the market supply curve is:
$$\begin{align}
P&=6q+10\\
&=6(\frac{Q}{100})+10\\
&=10+0.06Q,P\geq\$34
\end{align}$$
Now that we have market supply and demand, we can find the short run equilibrium:
$$\begin{align}
154-0.06Q&=10+0.06Q\\
144&=0.12Q\\
Q^*&=1200\\
P^*&=\$82
\end{align}$$

Each firm in the industry produces the same amount:
$$q^*=\frac{Q^*}{100}=\frac{1200}{100}=12$$

We can determine whether each firm makes economic profit:
$$\begin{align}
AC&=3(12)+10+\frac{432}{12}\\
&=82\\
\Pi&=TR-TC\\
&=(P^*-AC)q^*\\
&=(82-82)12\\
&=0
\end{align}$$
The firms make zero economic profit.

## Change in Demand
Suppose that the demand curve changes. This leads to the following:
* The market price changes
* The short-run market equilibrium shifts along the supply curve
* The change in price causes a change in behavior from each firm
* The economic profit of each firm changes

> An increase in demand leads to changes in the market and for each firm

## Change in Cost
Changes in the short run depend on whether it's a change in FC, VC, and in what amounts.

Suppose that there is a per-unit increase in cost by $n$ dollars:
* The firm and market supply curve shift up by $n$ dollars
* The short-run equilibrium shifts along the demand curve
* MC, AC, and AVC each shift up by $n$ dollars
* AFC does not shift
* $\min AC$ and $\min AVC$ each shift up by $n$ dollars
* Economic profits of each firm and industry are reduced
