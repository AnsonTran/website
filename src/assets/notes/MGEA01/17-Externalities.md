# Externalities
An **externality** is created when an action (e.g. creating or consuming a good) affects bystanders as well as market participants, with no payment or compensation that offsets the effects on bystanders.

A **bystander** is another member of society, not participating in the purchase or sale that is affected

## Market Failures
Competitive markets *usually* allocate resources to deliver maximum gain to society. However, they sometimes fail when:
|Failure|Reason|
|---|---|
|There is only a small number of producers (oligopoly) or only one producer (monopoly)|Not selling at marginal cost|
|A good or services has substantial external costs|Negative externalities|
|A good or service has substantial external benefits|Patents on new technologies with positive spillover|
|A good is a public good|Firms usually want payment, which excludes people from consuming the public good|

Markets do not receive the right signals about all the benefits and all the costs, and therefore make the wrong decisions. Consumers and producers do not face the correct incentives. They will consume and/or produce too much or too little of the good.
* **Coase theorem** - A small number of people are affected, so private negotiations can solve the problem
* **Market failure** - A large number of people are affected. Here, class action lawsuits might help

## External Benefits
External benefits are positive externalities. These can include:
* Education
* Developing new technologies
* Providing public art, open space in the city.

Total social benefit prices in the positive spillovers of goods (i.e. chocolate bar would have no positive spillover vs. covid vaccine)
$$\text{Total Social Benefit}=\text{Total Private Benefit}+\text{Total External Benefit}$$

As usual, we can also have marginal social benefit:
$$\frac{\Delta TSB}{\Delta Q}=MSB=MPB+MEB$$

In a perfect competition market, positive externalities are usually not priced in, resulting in loss.

## External Cost
External costs are negative externalities. These can include:
* Burning fossil fuels, creating pollution
* Second-hand smoke
* Noisy activities

Total social cost prices in the external costs to society (i.e. pollution).
$$\text{Total Social Cost}=\text{Total Private Cost}+\text{Total External Cost}$$

As usual, we can also have marginal social cost:
$$\frac{\Delta TSC}{\Delta Q}=MSC=MPC+MEC$$
In a perfect competition market, negative externalities are usually not priced in, resulting in loss.

## Gain to Society
Gain to society is the difference between social benefits and social costs.
$$\text{Gain to Society}=TSB-TSC$$

We can maximize gain to society by equating social benefits with social costs:
$$\begin{align}
\frac{\Delta GTS}{\Delta Q}=MSB-MSC&=0\\
MSB&=MSC
\end{align}$$

Under perfect competition for negative externality, we have the following areas:

> GTS=CS+PS-TEC

On the other hand, if we operate at the optimal outcome:

> GTS=CS+PS-TEC

## Pigovian Tax
A tax on suppliers that covers negative externalities and brings the equilibrium up to the marginal social cost.

> GTS=CS+PS+GS-TEC

Gain to society increases post-tax, so the excess burden is negative.

## Tradeable Emissions Permits
Each firm is allocated a certain number of emissions permits each year, which could be used to traded.
* Firms who have the **highest costs of abatement** seek to buy extra permits.
* Firms who have **low costs of abatement** seek to sell permits.
* Demand and supply for permits establish an equilibrium price for a fixed amount of pollution permits
* Public authority determines the amount of emissions that are allowed

In effect, a **fee for polluting** is implemented. Since firms make different decisions, the external cost becomes **internalized**.

## Subsidy
Subsidies are in effect a reverse tax. They can be:
* Provided to the supplier, shifting the supply curve down
* Provided to the consumer, shifting the demand curve upwards
