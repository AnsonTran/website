# Monopoly
Monopoly is an economic model characterized by:
* A single supplier with the maximum amount of market power
* The single firm picks the profit making price and quantity. They are a price maker, not a price taker.
* Barriers to entry exist, to keep other firms from entering

Monopolies may persist due to a variety of reasons:
1. Government license or restriction (patent)
2. Ownership of scarce but essential resource
3. Some other barrier to entry (e.g. huge advertising costs, manipulation of access to market)
4. Cost advantage - Economies of scale which are large relative to the size of the market.

## Efficiencies
When talking about efficiencies, there are three different types:
1. **Allocative** - Who gets what benefits or gains to society
2. **Productive** - Are cost minimized? At the minimum of average cost curve?
3. **Dynamic** - Efficiency over time. How does technology change? 

### Productive
Once the monopolist has chosen an optimal quantity $Q^*$, they make the output at the lowest cost.

However, it may or may not produce at the minimum of the long-run average (LRAC) cost curve $q_{\min LRAC}$.

### Allocative
At the chosen price, the marginal benefit to society exceeds the marginal revenue of the firm.
$$MB=P>MC=MR$$
Hence, the firm is not allocatively efficient.

The monopolist does not maximize [[13-Perfect Competition#Gain to Society|gain to society]]. Price is greater than the marginal cost, which implies that GTS can be increased.

### Dynamic
The monopolist can use the profit gained in order to perform R&D and innovate. This allows them to maintain their monopoly status.
