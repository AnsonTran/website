# Long-Run
The long run is a period of time long enough for all available adjustments to be made by all firms (and possible entrants) in the industry. 
* **Firms** get to pick the best size of capital and labor, with the lowest possible average cost of production (optimal level of not just L, but of K)
* **Industries** have the optimal number of firms. All firms that want to enter or exit have done so, in response to economic profit

In the long run, supply is more responsive in the long run to price changes (more elastic, i.e. flatter)

## Right Sized Firms
For a firm to be successful in the long-run, it has to choose the appropriate amount of capital. In order to do so, it chooses capital equipment such that $q=\min LRAC$. In other words, it operates at an efficient scale of production

In the long run, firm's choose capital and output to produce such that the price matches their marginal cost.
$$\begin{align}
\max_q\Pi&=TR-TC\\
\frac{\Delta\Pi}{\Delta q}&=MR-MC=0\\
MR&=LMC\\
P&=LMC&\text{[P=MR]}
\end{align}$$

Entry and exit of firms occur, until the economic profit of firms is zero.
$$P=LAC \leftrightarrow \Pi_{LR}=0$$

In other words, the firm operates in the long run efficient scale of production, $q_{MES}$.

## Number of Firms
In the short run, the number of firms is predetermined.
1. The industry equilibrium $S_{SR}=D$ is determined
2. Which gives us the short-run industry quantity $Q_{SR}^*$
3. The output per firm $q_{SR}^*$ is determined
$$Q_{SR}^*=q_{SR}^*\times\bar{n}$$

In the long run, the number of firms is variable
1. The industry equilibrium $S_{LR}=D$ is determined
2. Which gives us the long-run industry quantity $Q_{LR}^*$
3. The output per firm is determined from the LAC curve $q_{LR}^*=q_{MES}$
4. Given the above, the number of firms $n_{LR}$ is determined
$$Q_{LR}^*=\bar{q}_{LR}^*\times n_{LR}^*$$

In the long run, the number of firms is determined by entry and exit. Free entry and exit drives economic profit to **zero** in the long run.
$$\begin{align}
\Pi_{LR}^*&=(P_{LR}^*-AC(q_{LR}^*)\times q_{LR}^*\\
&=(P_{LR}^*-P_{LR}^*)\times q_{LR}^*\\
&=0\\
\end{align}$$
> $AC(q_{LR}^*)$ is the average cost at the optimal output per firm

## Long-Run Industry Supply Curve
The cost structure of a firm in a perfectly competitive market can change based on the size of the industry in the long-run.

### Constant Costs
In constant costs, the industry cost curve is constant. Each firm's cost structure is the same, and does not shift up or down.  If equilibrium quantity increases, new firms will enter. In the other case, firms will exit. 

> Suppose that market equilibrium calls for 1000 units, and each firm produces 10 units. There are 100 firms.
> Now, the  equilibrium calls for 10000 units, and each firm still produces 10 units. Instead, there will now be 1000 firms.

### Increasing Costs
In an increasing industry supply curve, new entries causes the typical firms cost curves to shift up, increasing their costs. This is known as an **external diseconomy**, since external forces outside the firms control cause the firms costs to increase.

> Growing oranges in Canada is difficult, but there is a small area around Niagara Falls where oranges can be grown. As market demand for oranges grow, more firms bid for that space, making that space more valuable and increasing opportunity costs.

### Decreasing Costs
In a decreasing industry supply curve, increased output and new entrants decrease the firms cost curves, and decreasing costs. This is known as an **external economy**.

> Auto firms tend to centralize in an area, such as in Windsor, Ontario. As new auto firms join, they can share parts and optimize their supply chains and leading to decreasing costs.

## Increase in Demand
Suppose initially, that the economic profit of each firm is zero. Suddenly, there is a spike in demand causing a shift of the demand curve upwards. The long-run supply curve is constant.

In the short run, no firms enter or exit resulting in each firm producing more output, and positive economic profit.

![[Pasted image 20220812213051.png]]

In the long run, new entrance cause a further increase in output. However, prices return to the equilibrium level, and economic profit gets driven back down to zero.

## Improvements in Technology
Suppose that there is an improvement in technology. This causes LAC, LMC, and SMC to shift downwards and to the right.

In the short run, the number of firms are held fixed:
* The short run supply curve shifts downwards.
* The short run equilibrium price drops, causing firms to increase output
* Each firm makes positive economic profit.

![[Pasted image 20220812233517.png]]

In the long run, the positive profit attracts new entrants to the industry.
* The short run curve shifts downwards even further to meet with the long run curve
* Price drops down further to the long-run price
* Each firm reduces output to the equilibrium amount
* Economic profit drops back down to zero
