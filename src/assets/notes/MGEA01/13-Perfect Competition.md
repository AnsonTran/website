# Perfect Competition
Perfect competition is a model in economics characterized by:
* Many buyers, many sellers (price takers)
* The most amount of competition
* Homogeneous good or standardized (no brand loyalty)
* Free entry and exit in the long-run (no long-run barriers to competition)
* Perfect information (consumers do not make mistakes... always find the lowest price)

Perfectly competitive markets do not exist, but serves as a good model. We can take existing markets and compare it to this model.

For a firm in a perfectly competitive market:
* It can't change its cost curves (based on technology and prices of inputs)
* It can't push up the price. It is a price taker.
* It can't distinguish its product from others by advertising or product innovation (product is homogeneous across suppliers)
* It can only choose the profit-maximizing level of output
