# Demand and Supply
A market is a set of institutional arrangements that bring buyers and sellers together to negotiate the terms for exchanging goods(tangible) or services(intangible).

A demand and supply curve shows the relationship between the demand of goods and the supply of goods. It shows the behavior of buyers in a market.

## Demand Curve
We usually assume that, all else the same, our marginal utility **decreases** as we add incremental units of consumption. One bowl of rice has lots of utility, but a second bowl has less, and a third moreso.

As a result, a demand curve is downward sloping, as the more quantity is available for consumption, the lower the price consumers are willing to pay.

## Supply Curve
The supply curve models the behavior of sellers. It shows the minimum price suppliers are willing to charge per unit for any particular quantity. This is equal to the firms marginal cost of production.

In the **short run**, supply has a **positive slope**. Resources, technology, and the number of firms are all held fixed.

In the **long-run**, supply is less steeply sloped, and is often **horizontal**. Resources, technology and the number of firms can be varied.

## Equilibrium
Equilibrium occurs when the behavior of buyers and sellers is **consistent**. In other words, the amount buyers want to buy matches the amount sellers want to sell.

Prices play a key role in markets, often called the *invisible hand* of the market. It acts as a signalling device, providing information to encourage consumers and sellers to change behaviors, so that competitive markets move into equilibrium.

Prices act to allocate resources in a competitive market, and determines which demanders and suppliers are successful.

## Perfectly Competitive Market
A perfectly competitive market meets the following conditions:
1. Many buyers, many sellers
2. Product is homogeneous or standardized (little brand loyalty)
3. Perfect information (no one is fooled)
4. Free entry and exit in the long run (no barriers to entry or exit)

In this environment, producers/consumers have no market power, and price competition is the main form that competition takes.

## Shifts in Demand
Price is not the only factor that affects demand. There can be many others. A change in any of the factors behind demand, shifts the demand curve.

**Change in quantity demanded** is a movement along the demand curve, due to a change in price.

**Change in demand**, refers to an increase or decrease in demand due to a shift of the demand curve (non-price factors). An increase in demand shifts the curve to the right, whille a decrease in demand shifts the curve to the left.

### Price of a Substitute($P_S$)
An increase in a substitute, causes a positive change in demand. For example, an increase in the price of butter, causes the demand curve for margarine to shift to the right.

### Price of a Complement($P_C$)
An increase in the price of a complement, causes a negative change in demand. For example, an increase in the price of popcorn, causes the demand curve for cola to shift to the left.

### Income of Consumers(I)
The income of consumers could cause a shift in the demand curve, depending on the item.

A **normal good** is a good that sees an increase in demand as the wages of the population increases. For example, food and clothing.

An **inferior good** is a good that sees a decrease in demand as the wages of the population increases. For example, instant noodles, hamburgers, canned goods, frozen dinners.

### Population(N)
An increase in the population, increases demand.

### Tastes(T)
If tastes shift towards the good or services, this causes an increase in demand. However, if tastes shift away from a good or service, this causes a decrease in demand.

## Shifts in Supply
Similarly to demand, prices are not the only factors that affect supply. 

**Change in quantity supplied** is a movement along the supply curve, due to a change in the price.

**Change in supply** is a change in other factors that shifts the entire supply curve. An increase in supply leads to a downward shift, while a decrease in supply leads to an upwards shift.

### Price of Labour($P_L$)
Labour is a major input to production. An increase in labour increases the marginal cost of production, resulting in a decrease in supply.

### Price of Capital Goods($P_K$)
Capital goods include tools, equipment, machinery, and factories. A decrease in the price of capital goods causes a decrease in marginal cost of production, and an increase in supply.

### Technology(Z)
Changes in technology is usually cost-saving. Improvements in technology lowers the marginal cost of production, and an increase in supply.

## Price Fixing
Prices can also be affected by government interference, through a price ceiling or price floor. In order for it to take affect it has to be binding. It can also depend how rigorously this is enforced.
$$P_{MAX}<P*,\text{ or } P_{MIN}>P*$$
### Price Ceilings
Rent control is an example of a price ceiling. If it is rigorously enforced, it can lead to shortage of housing, black markets, and deterioration of properties. Overall, everyone is worse off.

### Price Floors
Minimum wages, and minimum prices in agriculture are examples of price floors. If rigorously enforced, it leads to unemployment, and illegal workers. In addition, resources will not move to new occupations.
