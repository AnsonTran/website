# Costs
Recall the definition of total cost, which is the sum of cost of capital equipment and the cost of labour.
$$\begin{align}
TC&=P_KK+P_LL\\
&=\text{Fixed Cost}+\text{Variable Cost}
\end{align}$$

In the short run, prices are fixed, and capital is fixed. The firm gets to decide the units of labour, which is variable.

> $P_K$ - Price of capital
> $K$ - Units of capital
> $P_L$ - Price of labour
> $L$ - Units of labour (variable)
