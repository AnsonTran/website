# Production
We assume that the objective of firms is to **maximize profits**.
1. Hire labour and purchase (or rent) capital equipment and other inputs
2. Use available technology to combine the inputs together to produce output
3. Output is sold to earn a profit (or loss)

**Economic profit** includes all (implicit) opportunity costs of owner's time and capital.
$$\begin{align}
\pi&=TR-TC&[\text{total revenue and costs}]\\
&=P\times Q-[P_L\times L + P_K\times K] &[\text{labour and capital}]\\
\end{align}$$

### Example
Suppose that you and four other friends are in a lawn mowing business. You have only one lawnmower (fixed amount of capital). Imagine the following is the **production function**.
|Workers|Lawns Mowed|MPL|APL|AC|MC|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|5|5|5|$16|$10
|2|9|4|4.5|$14.44|$12.50
|3|12|3|4|$15|$16.67|
|4|14|2|3.5|$16.43|$25|
|5|15|1|3|$18.67|$50|
   
**Marginal Product of Labour** is the additional output from an additional worker
$$MP_L=\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta L}$$
1. 5 lawns for the first worker
2. 4 more for the second worker
3. 3 more for the third worker
4. 2 more for the fourth worker
5. 1 more for the fifth worker

**Average Product of Labour** is the average output per worker.
$$AP_L=\frac{q}{L}$$
1. 5 lawns per worker when there is 1 worker
2. 4.5 lawns per worker when there are 2 workers
3. 4 lawns per worker when there are 3 workers
4. 3.5 lawns per worker when there are 4 workers
5. 3 lawns per worker when there are 5 workers

If the rental on the lawnmower costs $\$30$ per day (cost of capital equipment) and the wage paid to each worker is $\$50$ per day, then the **total cost** is:
1. $\$80$ to cut 5 lawns per day
2. $\$130$ to cut 9 lawns per day
3. $\$180$ to cut 12 lawns per day
4. $\$230$ to cut 14 lawns per day
5. $\$280$ to cut 15 lawns per day

**Average cost** per lawn is the total cost divided by the number of lawns.
$$AC=\frac{TC}{q}$$
**Marginal cost** is the cost of cutting the next lawn.
$$MC=\frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta q}$$
In the short run, with fixed inputs (capital equipment), average cost and marginal curves have these shapes:
