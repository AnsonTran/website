# Monopolists
Similarly to [[13.1-Firms|perfect competition]], the monopolist tries to maximize profit. This occurs when marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.
$$MR=MC$$

## Price as a Function of Output
As a price maker, the monopolist determines a quantity $Q^*$ to produce, which determines a price $P^*$ on the demand curve as the price.
$$P^*=D(Q^*)$$

## Shutdown Condition
The monopolist is not guaranteed to make money. There needs to be a demand for the product depending on consumers maximum willingness to pay.

The monopolist operates when the price level is above average variable cost. Otherwise, it must shutdown.
$$P\geq AVC,\ \text{otherwise}\ Q^*=0$$

## Marginal Revenue
For the monopolist, price is a chosen variable. We must treat $P$ as a function of $Q$. Hence, marginal revenue is:
$$\begin{align}
MR=\frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q}&=\frac{\Delta P\times Q}{\Delta Q}\\
&=P+Q(\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q})\\
&=P(1+\frac{Q}{P}(\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q}))\\
&=P(1-\frac{1}{E_d})
\end{align}$$
> $E_d$ is [[06-Elasticity#Elasticity of Demand|elasticity of demand]]

For a linear demand curve $P=a-bQ$, marginal revenue has the same price intercept with twice the slope. 
$$\begin{align}
TR=P\times Q&=(a-bQ)Q\\
&=aQ-bQ^2\\
MR=\frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q}&=a-2bQ
\end{align}$$

Suppose the market demand function is $P=100-0.2Q$. Then:
* Total revenue is $TR=P\times Q=100Q-0.2Q^2$
* Marginal revenue is $MR=100-0.4Q$

## Marginal Cost
Marginal cost is calculated in the same way as usual, depending on the total cost curve.

## Supply Rule
The profit maximizing monopolist sets the price where marginal revenue MR is equal to marginal cost MC. This determines the quantity supplied, resulting in a **supply point**, rather than a **supply curve**.

## Profit
Recall that profit is the difference between the price and the average cost:
![[13.1-Firms#^4512b9]]

While this difference was zero in the perfect competition case, the monopolist has positive profit.

In the long run, profit is pretty much the same!

## Price Discrimination
For the monopolist, there are unexploited marginal trades that can occur. Through **price discrimination**, the monopolist can charge less for the next marginal unit, as long as it is above marginal cost. This leads to additional consumer surplus and producer surplus

However, if people who bought at the market price found out, they may demand that they get a reduced price.
