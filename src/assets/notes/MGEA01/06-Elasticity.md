# Elasticity
Elasticity has implications on **tax incidence** (who pays a tax, producers or consumers), and **tax burdens** (what is the burden on society of the tax).![[SmartSelect_20220627-230952_Samsung Notes.jpg]]

## Elasticity of Demand
**Elasticity of demand** is how sensitive the quantity demanded is to changes in the price of the product.
$$\begin{align}
E_D&=\bigg|(\frac{\Delta Q^D}{\Delta P})\times(\frac{P}{Q})\bigg|\\
&=\bigg|\frac{\Delta Q^D}{Q}\bigg/{\frac{\Delta P}{P}}\bigg|\\
&=\bigg|\frac{\text{Percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\text{Percentage change in price}}\bigg |
\end{align}$$
In other words, how consumers respond to a change in market price as we move along the demand curve, called the **own price elasticity of demand**.

Thinking about different goods, some have **more** elastic demands, while others have **less** elastic demands.
1. Availability of close substitutes (few substitutes for cigarettes)
2. Amount spent on this good by the consumer (bubble gum is a low percentage of budget)
3. Cost of switching products (iOS operating system)
4. Degree of necessity or luxury and habitual consumption (cigarettes, alcohol, etc. become a habit)
5. Peak and off-peak demand
6. Breadth of definition of a good or service (bottled drink vs. soda vs. coke)
7. Time period following price change (short run vs. long run)

Demand is called:
* **elastic** - if $E_D>1$ (i.e. $P$ increases by $1\%$, $Q^D$ decreases by more than $1\%$)
* **inelastic** - if $E_D<1$ (i.e. $P$ increases by $1\%$, $Q^D$ decreases by less than $1\%$)
* **unit(ary) elastic** - if $E_D=1$ (i.e. $P$ increases by $1\%$, $Q^D$ decreases by $1\%$)

## Total Expenditure
Suppliers are concerned with the total expenditure, for a given price and quantity demanded. If there are no taxes, this gives us the amount of consumer spend and the revenue.
$$TE=P\times Q$$
If the current price is elastic, increasing the price causes an overall loss in the total expenditure and revenue.

In the other case, if the current price is inelastic, an increase in price results in a net gain in the total expenditure and revenue.

At the point of unit elasticity, the total expenditure peaks. The change in total expenditure is 0.

Change in total expenditure is given as:
$$\begin{align}
\frac{\Delta TE}{\Delta P}&=\frac{\Delta}{\Delta P}P\times Q\\
&=(\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta P}Q)+(\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}P)\\
&=Q+(\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}P)\\
&=Q\bigg[1+\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}\frac{P}{Q}\bigg]\\
&=Q[1-E_D]
\end{align}$$
Total expenditure depending on the change in price.
$$\begin{align}
E_D=1&\rightarrow\frac{\Delta TE}{\Delta P}=0\\
E_D>1&\rightarrow \frac{\Delta TE}{\Delta P}<0\\
E_D<1&\rightarrow \frac{\Delta TE}{\Delta P}>0
\end{align}$$
Equivalent change in total expenditure:
$$\frac{\Delta TE}{\Delta P}=P\bigg[1-\frac{1}{E_D}\bigg]$$
Toal expenditure depending on the change in quantity demanded.
$$\begin{align}
E_D=1&\rightarrow\frac{\Delta TE}{\Delta Q}=0\\
E_D>1&\rightarrow \frac{\Delta TE}{\Delta Q}>0\\
E_D<1&\rightarrow \frac{\Delta TE}{\Delta Q}<0
\end{align}$$

### Example
Suppose a demand curve is given as:
$$P=100-Q$$
At a quantity of $Q=80$, $P=\$20$.
$$E_D=|(-1)\times(20/80)|=1/4$$
If price decreases by $4\%$, then we expect quantity demanded to change by about $1\%$.

## Elasticity of Supply
**Elasticity of supply** is how sensitive the quantity of product supplied by businesses to changes in the price is.
> How sensitive is the quantity of tomatoes supplied by businesses to changes in the price of tomatoes in Ontario?

$$\begin{align}
E_S&=\frac{\Delta Q^S}{\Delta P}\times\frac{P}{Q}\\
&=\frac{\text{Percentage change in quantity supplied}}{\text{Percentage change in price}}
\end{align}$$
It tells us how producers respond to a change in market price, as we move along the supply curve.
