# Introduction
Microeconomics is the study of individual markets in the economy (demand and supply, determining price and quantity exchanged). It helps us to understand how decisions are made, through markets, to allocate society's economic resources to alternate possible uses.

A few important principles in microeconomics:
* People face trade-offs: Choices are necessary because resources are scarce
* The cost of something is what you give up to get it
* People think at the margin. Decisions about whether to do a little bit more or a little big less of an activity are marginal decisions
* People respond to incentives. Assume agents are rational, they will exploit opportunities to make themselves better off
* Trade can make everyone better off
* Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity
* Markets tend to move to equilibrium (on their own)
* Governments can sometimes improve upon market outcomes. If markets fail to be efficient, government intervention can improve society's welfare

## Resources
Resources (or factors of production) are the inputs in an economy.
1. **Land** - Used as a production site and all the natural resources (found on/in the land) used in production
2. **Labour** - All the effort exerted by employed workers and their human capital (education, experience, and know-how)
3. **Capital** - Buildings, machinery, and equipment used to make output

Resources are scarce, implying that constraints exist and trade-offs must be made. Multiple competing uses of a resources means a choice must be made as to its use.

## Economy
Economies must decide what to make, how to make it, and for whom the output is distributed. There are three ways this can happen
1. **Market Economy** - Market economies are decentralized, where buyers and sellers interact in output markets(new products), and in input markets (rent resources or factors of production).
2. **Command Economy** - Central control of the economy, where the government decides the what, how, and for whom
3. **Mixed Economy** - Mixed economies are a mix of both

## Opportunity Cost
The cost of taking an action is measured by the value of the **next best** alternative action. In other words, the value produced by the resources used, if you had used these same resources in an alternative way.

Based on scarcity of resources, if you do something, you have to give up doing something else you might have done. Opportunity costs consist of both **implicit** costs and **explicit costs**.
* **Explicit costs** - Money/monetary costs
* **Implicit costs** - Non-monetary costs (using your own resources)
