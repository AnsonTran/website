# Profit
The firms objective is to maximize profit. This includes **all costs**, including the labour and capital of the owner if they are involved.
$$\max_q \Pi=TR-TC$$

## Economic Profit
Suppose a coffee business has the following data:
|Data|Value|
|---|---|
|Sales revenue|$6800|
|Rental space|$2500|
|Labour and other inputs|$3300|
|Opportunity cost of owners labour|$800|
|Normal return of owners money|$200|

The **accounting profit** only counts the explicit payments for labour and rental:
$$\begin{align}
\text{Accounting profit}&=\text{Revenue}-\text{Explicit Costs}\\
&=$1000
\end{align}$$
The **economic profit** must include costs of all resources used by the business that have alternate opportunities (i.e. the labour of the owner and family, and interest on owner-invested capital):
$$\begin{align}
\text{Economic profit}&=\text{Revenue}-\text{Explicit Costs}-\text{Implicit Costs}\\
\text{Economic profit}&=\text{Revenue}-\text{Opportunity Costs}\\
&=$0
\end{align}$$
> Opportunity costs are evaluated at fair market prices.

## Maximum Profit
Both $TR$ and $TC$ are functions of $q$, hence profit is maximized when:
$$\begin{align}
\frac{\Delta\Pi}{\Delta q}&=0\\
\frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta q}-\frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta q}&=0\\
MR-MC&=0\\
MR&=MC
\end{align}$$
Hence, in order to maximize profit, a firm has to choose quantity such that marginalk cost is equal to marginal revenue.
