# Taxation
An **excise** tax is a tax on one particular product (not a general tax on many products) ^9d778d
> gasoline, liquor, cigarettes

A **flat-rate** tax is a set tax per quantity of a particular product
> $\$5$ per bottle of liquor, $\$0.30$ per litre of gasoline, $\$10$ per carton of cigarettes

An **ad-valorem** tax is a percentage of the price of a product
> $10\%$ of the price on a bottle of liquor, $\%25$ on a litre of gasoline, $30\%$ on a carton of cigarettes

For the course, we will only look at a flat-rate excise tax.

Two interesting questions comes up:
1. Who really pays an excise tax and what does this depend on?
2. How does taxation affect the allocation of society's economic resources and economic well-being?

In economics language:
1. What is the **incidence** of an excise tax (who bears the burden of an excise tax?)
2. How much is the **excess burden** of an excise tax (also known as the **deadweight loss** due to the tax)?

The market decides who will bear the tax, depending on how consumers and producers react to the tax. In other words, incidence of the tax depends on the **elasticity of demand** and the **elasticity of supply**.

A tax drives a **wedge** between buyers and sellers. Buyers pay one price (including the tax), but sellers receive another price.

## Tax on consumers
If the tax is levied on consumers, we have two demand curves.
1. Curve $D$ represents the amount buyers pay including the tax
2. Curve $D-T$ represents the amount sellers receive, net of the tax.

To find the new equilibrium with a flat tax per unit:
1. Find $D-T$ curve
2. Find where $D-T=S$, to determine $Q_1$
3. Plug $Q_1$ into either $D-T$ or $S$ to find $P_S$
4. Plug $Q_1$ into $D$ to find $P_1$
5. $P_1=P_S+T$

## Tax on producers
If the tax is levied on producers, we have two supply curves.
1. Curve $S$ is the original supply curve, and represents the net amount sellers receive (not including the tax) for supplying different numbers of units of the good
2. Curve $S+T$ represents the amount buyers will pay for the same numbers of units of the good (including the tax)

The **buyer's share of tax** is given as:
$$BS=P_1-P_0$$

The **seller's share of tax** is given by:
$$SS=P_0-P_S$$

Although tax is levied by governments on either consumers or producers, tax is generally **shared** between buyers and sellers.

Amount that buyers pay vs amount sellers pay depends on elasticity of demand and elasticity of supply according to this formula:
$$\frac{BS}{SS}=\frac{E_S}{E_D}$$
## Fixed Quantity
Fixed amount of demanded quantity. Buyers only want to buy a fixed amount regardless of quantity supplied. Thus, they absorb all of the tax burden.

Fixed amount of supplied quantity. Sellers want to sell this quantity at any price. Thus they absorb all of the tax burden.

## Fixed Price
Buyers demand a fixed price, regardless of the amount of supply. Thus, producers bear the tax burden.

Sellers demand a fixed price, regardless of the amount of demand. Thus, consumers bear the tax burden.

## Excess Burden
When a tax is levied, it changes the behaviours of buyers and sellers.
1. Because gross price $P_1$ is higher, consumers want to consume less.
2. Because net price $P_S=P_1-T$ is lower, suppliers want to supply less.

Therefore, less output is produced and consumed in this industry. Economic resources are reallocated to other industries and away from this industry.

## Well Being
Well-being (economic surplus or total welfare) can be measured as the sum of:
$$\text{consumer surplus + producer surplus + government surplus=the net benefit of society}$$

**Consumer surplus** is the surplus of consumer utility over the amount paid for the good (measured in dollars). The net benefit to consumers.
$$CS=U-TE$$ ^cbb875

**Producer surplus** is the surplus of revenues to producers over the amount necessary to get them to supply the good (measured in dollars). The net benefit to producers.
$$PS=TR-TVC$$ ^0c7753

**Government surplus** is equal to the revenue the tax generates.
$$GTS=CS+PS+GS$$

Consumer and producer surplus is lost when taxes are levied. In addition, **deadweight loss** or **excess burden** fails to be captured by tax revenue.

Taxes bring benefits too! The government needs tax revenue to pay the cost of important social programs such as welfare, hospitals, schools, roads, etc.

We have ignored other possible costs, such as whether rich/poor pays the tax, and the dollar cost to collect the revenue.
