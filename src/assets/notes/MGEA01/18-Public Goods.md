# Public Goods
A good or service consumed collectively and is difficult to exclude people from consuming.

**Rivalry** and **excludability** are two factors to consider when deciding whether a good is a public good:
* **Non-rival** - Collective consumption, with no private cost (MPC=0)
* **Non-excludable** - If one consumer has access, all consumers have access (MEB >0)

| |Excludable|Non-excludable|
|---|---|---|
|**Rival**|Private goods: Chocolate bar, haircut|Common property resources: parks, fisheries, lakes|
|**Non-rival**|Natural monopolies:toll roads, art galleries, movie theatres|Public goods: national defence, public health, police|

Since public goods have positive external benefits, but no one wants to pay for them, governments can:
* Provide the public good
* Pay others to provide the public good

## Demand Curve
Recall when we talked about the demand curves for regular goods, we summed up each participants marginal utility to get the market demand curve. $Q$ is the sum of all the little $q$'s.

![[05-Utility#Market Demand]]

With a public good, since the benefits are shared with everyone, government only needs to supply a given quantity.
$$Q=q$$

Each participant has the following marginal utility function:
$$MU=P=A-Bq$$

Market demand is the sum of all the demand curves. Suppose there are $n$ people.
$$P=\sum MU=\sum(A-Bq)=nA-nBq=nA-nBQ$$

In effect, we take the vertical sum of the demand curves.
