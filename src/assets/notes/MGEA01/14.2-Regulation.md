# Regulation
Government has a few options depending on which efficiencies it wants to optimize for. First, the government must consider:
* Is allocative efficiency the only measure? What about dynamic efficiency?
* Why does monopoly exist? Is the barrier to entry a government patent? Economies of scale?
* What can government do? Can it restore competition? Regulate the monopolist? Will the results be better?

## Excise Tax
An [[07-Taxation#^9d778d|excise tax]] is a tax on each unit of product.
* The demand curve gets shifted down by the size of the tax
* A new marginal revenue curve is generated by the tax
* Prices paid by the consumer is increased
* Quantity supplied by the firm is reduced
* Price received by suppliers is reduced
* Social welfare is reduced, meaning that there is **excess burden**

## Marginal Cost Pricing
The government forces the monopolist to charge a price equal to marginal cost.
$$\begin{align}
\Pi&=(P-AC)Q\\
&=(P-AVC-AFC)Q\\
&=(P-AVC)Q-FC\\
&=-FC
\end{align}$$

However, with this pricing, the monopolist earns no profit, and loses their fixed costs. The monopolist would require the fixed costs to be subsidized.

## Average Cost Pricing
The government forces the monopolist to charge a price equal to the average cost.
$$\Pi=(P-AC)Q=0$$

The monopolist makes no profit, so no subsidy is required.

## Comparison
| |Natural Monopoly|Marginal Cost Pricing|Average Cost Pricing|
|---|---|---|---|
|$P$|Highest|Lowest|Between|
|$Q$|Lowest|Highest|Between|
|$CS$|Lowest|Highest|Between|
|Profit|Highest|Lowest($-FC$)|Between($=0$)|
|$GTS$|Lowest|Highest|Between|

Marginal cost pricing results in the highest consumer surplus, but requires that governments subsidize the fixed costs.
