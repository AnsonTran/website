# Utility
Demand curves reflect the **utility** (or well-being, satisfaction, happiness) of consumers, measured in dollars. Demand curves can be used to measure the willingness-to-pay for a good by consumers.

Individuals who consume(or not) are making decisions designed to maximize their own well-being, with the income they have available.

Suppose Fred has the following utility function, where $Q$ is the number of hamburgers consumed per month.
$$U=20Q-Q^2$$
## Marginal Utility
Fred's marginal utility is found by taking the derivative of the utility function.
$$\text{Marginal Utility}=\frac{dU}{dQ}=20-2Q$$

As we can see, at some point, Fred's utility decreases after 10 hamburgers. Eating the first hamburger gives $\$20$ of utility, while eating the 11th hamburger gives $\$0$ of utility. If there is no cost to consuming hamburgers, he will eat exactly 10 hamburgers per month.

## Net Gain
Fred wants to maximize his **net gain** from consuming hamburgers. He gains utility from consuming hamburgers, but has to pay for the hamburgers. The net gain is the difference between these, called **consumer surplus**.
$$\text{Consumer Surplus}=U(Q)-(P\times Q)$$

Fred seeks to maximize his consumer surplus.
$$\frac{dCS}{dQ}=\frac{dU}{dQ}-P=0$$
Therefore, when the slope of the utility function (i.e. marginal utility) is equal to the price, consumer surplus is maximized.
$$MU=20-2Q=P$$
Rational consumers follow the **Optimal Purchase Rule**(OPR), and the demand curve is the result. The demand curve and MU curve are the same.

## Optimal Purchase Rule
Keep purchasing the good up to the point where the marginal utility (of the last unit purchased/consumed) is equal to the price charged per unit $P$. This gives us the demand curve:
$$MU=P$$
1. When $MU>P$, we have consumed too little $Q$. The next unit returns **more** additional utility than it costs $P$ to buy
2. When $MU<P$, we have consumed too much $Q$. The last unit bought returned **less** additional utiliy than it cost to $P$ to buy, and lowered consumer surplus $CS$

For our example, given a constant $P$, the quantity demand is given by:
$$Q=\frac{20-P}{2}=10-0.5P$$
The demand curve is then given by:
$$P=20-2Q$$

## Market Demand
For a group of individuals, we can find the combined market demand by adding their demand curves together horizontally.

Suppose we have the following demand curves:

|Name|Demand|
|---|---|
|Jane|$P=10-0.5q$|
|John|$P=10-0.25q$|
|Joe|$P=10-0.333q$|
|Jill|$P=10-q$|

First, we express each person's demand curve as a function of $q$ in terms of $P$.

|Name|Demand|
|---|---|
|Jane|$q=20-2P$|
|John|$q=40-4P$|
|Joe|$q=30-3P$|
|Jill|$q=10-P$|

Then, the quantity demanded is expressed as:
$$Q=\sum q=100-10P$$

The demand curve for the market is:
$$P=10-0.1Q$$

If consumers have different marginal utilities for the first good, then it can result in a kinked market demand curve, as shown below.
