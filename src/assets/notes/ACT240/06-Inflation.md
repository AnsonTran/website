# Inflation
Inflation is an increase in the price of a basket of goods and services representative of the economy as a whole.

Alternatively, it represents the reduction in purchasing power over time. Inflation also affects the return on investment.

An effective interest rate can be decomposed as such:
$$1+i=(1+i_{inf})(1+i_{real})$$
where $i_{inf}$ is the rate of inflation for the period, and $i_{real}$ is the real rate of return. 

### Example
Suppose that inflation is at an annual effective of $5\%$. What interest rate must be charged by a lender in order to realize a real annual effective return of $4\%$?
