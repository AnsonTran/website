# Loan Defaults
When the government issues debt through a security, it is generally assumed that they are *risk-free*, meaning the government will pay its obligations with full certainty.

Some borrowers are not as secure as a federal government and the possibility of default on a loan may exist for them. In order to compensate for this rate, a lender typically charges a higher interest rate to borrowers who may default than that charged to a risk-free borrower, called a **risky rate**.

The difference between rate of interest charged to risky borrowers and that charged to risk-free borrowers is called the **credit spread**.

### Example
A lender has set a $5\%$ annual effective interest rate for loans to borrowers who are risk free. The lender has identified a class of borrowers and an analysis of their repayment behavior indicates that a borrower in that class has a $90\%$ chance of making full repayment and a $10\%$ chance of default. Determine the annual effective interest rate that the lender should charge to ther borrowers in this class so that the lender will expect to receive the same return that would be recieved for loans made to risk-free borrowers.
